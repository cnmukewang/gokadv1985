### Origin of All Life in the Universe

I once asked Norton and the others, "How did we Earthlings come to be? Many of us say God created them. I don't really believe it. You guys are so technologically advanced. I do believe it when you say you created them."

Norton said, "Our current level of technology allows us to create human bodies. The bodies we have now been manufactured, not naturally reproduced. But our bodies were not man-made at the beginning.

"You earthlings, we Goks, intelligent people on other planets in the universe, on all planets where there are humans, where there is life, the vast majority of life did not spread from other planets, nor was it created by anything.

"There are planets with life in the universe, where people and lower life evolved almost step by step from lower life. You earthlings were not created by God or gods either. They evolved as well. God or gods do not exist. You earthlings created them yourselves.

"We now can create everything from simple life to all kinds of advanced life, as well as our own bodies. Only later did our technology develops to the point where we could artificially create life and our own bodies.

"The origin of all life on your planet was a lightning bolt a billion years ago, and the October conception of your Earth woman was to express this billion-year process. The lightning struck the nitrogen in the air and created complex macromolecules that then fell into the water and formed certain simple amino acids and proteins. Created certain of the earliest classes of viruses capable of self-replication and then progressed step by step from the lower to the complex and higher levels.

"All advanced organisms and civilizations are survivors of viral slaughter in the universe. In the sea of viruses, creatures that have managed to evolve to a higher level can hardly escape the carnage of viruses. Even if some of them succeed in evolving into advanced creatures, the vast majority will eventually choose to degenerate towards virus-like simple creatures.

"This leads to the universe, have simple virus-like creatures on the planet, the probability of truly born advanced creatures and civilizations, less than one in 100 million. Because in the process of biological evolution, the simpler the structure, the more dominant.

"Scientists on your planet generally believe that man evolved from apes and monkeys. And apes evolved from reptiles; reptiles evolved from aquatic animals; aquatic animals swam out of the ocean.

"This view is not accurate enough. Early lightning strikes of nitrogen gas fell into some small ponds and ditches on land to form early life, while life in the ocean from the land ditches, ponds, small rivers, small lakes with the flow of water over.

"The earliest life that reproduced was in small ponds on land, not in the ocean. Because of seawater's high salt and other chemical content, the high mineral content, the high winds and waves, and the harsh environment, it was not suitable for early life to reproduce.

"Earlier, more advanced organisms also lived in fresh water on land, eventually evolving into various fish. Many marine organisms migrated from freshwater to the ocean, gradually adapted to the ocean, and then lived in the ocean for a long time. Freshwater fish on land swam to the sea, and some did not adapt to the marine environment and died. 

"However, freshwater fish have constantly been swimming in the ocean for billions of years. Some gradually adapt to the marine environment and finally become marine fish.

"It is even more challenging for the fish in the ocean to swim against the current to the land. On land, where freshwater surges, organisms evolve faster than in the ocean.

"In the early days, only fresh water on land was suitable for early virus-like organisms.

"In the beginning, there was no distinction between plants and animals, but later, in order to survive and adapt to their environment, early virus-like microorganisms began to distinguish between plants and animals. Some viruses arose from the degeneration of higher organisms. During the evolution of organisms, to adapt to their environment and survive, sometimes genes degenerate and reverse in a simpler direction.

"How did freshwater fish on land evolve on land?

"On land, sometimes it rains heavily, and some fish in rivers and lakes swim around with the surging water to feed and end up in small ponds, a dry land. As the rainy season passes and sunny days come, the water in the small ponds gradually dries up, and many fish die.

"The remaining small fish ran to the center of the small pond, with a bit of water in the center of the small pond. To maintain life, they waited in pain. Finally, most of them died, but there are still a few fish lucky to finally wait until the next rainy season. They were saved and swam back into the water.

"In the billions of years, repeatedly staged such a scene so that some fish are particularly resistant to drought and water torture, some fish have evolved to no water can also live for some time. For example, the blackfish on your planet can survive for a few days without water. Later, the blackfish evolved into loach. Loach can live without water for a few months or so. The loach developed and later evolved into the eel. The eel went further than the loach and could live longer without water, even up to a year. Eels finally evolved into snakes. Snakes can leave the water completely, as long as in a wet environment can survive.

"The snake evolved to later become a turtle. The tortoise evolved to the point where the shell of the tortoise's body fell off, becoming an animal like a rabbit. Animals like rabbits then evolved into animals like apes and monkeys. Animals like apes and monkeys eventually evolved into what you now call humans.

"Animals evolved eyes, which also evolved slowly. Early biological cells could feel the heat of the sun, so they could tell from which direction the sun was shining, and they could tell from the left or from the right. Slowly evolving, creatures eventually grew eyes that could see various images of the cosmic world reflected by light.

"Humans and certain creatures have now evolved to perceive not only light, sound, heat, electricity, magnetic ..., Some can also perceive fields, perceive space-time, acceleration, etc., and even perceive future information stored in space.

"Your earthlings had a tail when the fetus was first formed, only to disappear later. In fact, this tail was meant to trace the evolution of man from fish. "
