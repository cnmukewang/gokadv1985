## Chapter 1 
### Taken From Home

In the early summer when I was 19 years old (1985), the weather was not very hot and the bed was not yet covered with mosquito nets. I slept alone in the second room of the front row of the house (counting from the west), and my parents slept in the first room.

There were five houses in the row, with the front door in the middle, windows on both sides of the house, and no windows on the front door of the two adjacent houses. I slept at the front door of a windowless house on the west side, with no wall separating the front door from the hall.

I was taken out of the room by the aliens and travelled straight through the wall, without even opening the front door to exit. I was impressed by the earthy smell inside the walls as I passed through them.

The six houses made of bricks and stone, still exist today and were probably renovated after 1985, and another house was built on the east side. And in 1985, all five houses had earthen walls.

The bed I slept on was made of wooden boards, it was not a real bed. And near the dirt wall on the south side of the house, the walls were covered with newspaper to keep the dirt on the wall from falling onto the bed.

I slept with my feet facing west, and the west side was about 1.5 meters from the room where my parents slept. The aliens came in through this dirt wall, and we also went out through this dirt wall.

The door to my parents' room was also not far from this place. In those days, all the floors were dirt, not concrete.

On that occasion, I lay down for a short while, half asleep, and seemed to feel something hovering over the roof of my house, that familiar feeling I had as a child: they're coming, they're coming ... then they reappeared.

Not long after, I suddenly felt the house turn red. I woke up, got out of bed, and stood by it. I saw a glowing liquid oozing from the walls, which emitted a dark red color interspersed with some snowy blue light, and gradually turned into several human forms as the liquid completely seeped from the walls into the house.

There were human bodies all clustered together like countless flying red bugs, moving fast, and dancing in bursts.  

Intense fear made me tremble, and my arms and legs, and throat became stiff and stopped listening to my brain.

These mysterious people who came did not speak, but I seemed to hear in my head a standard male voice coming from nowhere saying to me, "Come with us."

At this point, I was still awake and clearly cognizant that I was not dreaming.

I was at a loss for words when I suddenly felt an invisible force come from the front and take control of me instantly. In particular, my head seemed to be filled suddenly with liquid and fine sand, or something, and there was a strong sense of numbness.

Consciousness also seems to be strongly controlled by the mysterious force, becoming blurred, and the brain's thinking and judgment are not sensitive. The whole person is not awake, and all kinds of senses seem to be dulled. The body fluttered and walked unsteadily.

After a while, I gradually stopped trembling, and the feeling of fear was greatly reduced.

I saw them pass through the wall, and I seemed to see the wall become translucent, and I followed them. When I came out, I saw that I was barefoot, wearing only a sweatshirt and shorts, and my image was destroyed.

When I touched the wall, I was particularly impressed by its earthy smell. The feeling of walking through the wall was that every molecule of it, passed evenly through my body, rather than the feeling of the wall cracking open a gap for a person to pass through.

Also, when a person wears a wall, all parts of the body have an indescribable feeling, far different from the feeling of not wearing a wall, instead it feels like there are countless tiny grains of sand gently rubbing in my body, accompanied by a hint of pleasure. The speed of going through the wall is not very fast, more like the usual speed of walking.

When I was about to come out of the wall, there was numbness and pain in my heels, but when I came out, the numbness and pain immediately disappeared.

Also, when I got outside the wall, I saw two more people, one was holding an object shining against the wall, and at that time I guessed that it was probably because of this object shining against the wall that the wall became translucent.

The people who walked through the wall and the people who took out something to shine on the wall, these people were able to change at will between being liquid and solid, their bodies were constantly trembling slightly, they looked as if they had a floating feeling, I guessed at the time that these floating people were not real people, but probably a kind of robot, which was later on confirmed.

I walked out through the wall, and although it was night, I saw something. There was probably a light source in this place, and I saw another person that felt like a real person. This person was a female at first glance, but she was noticeably shorter than an adult on Earth.

As I approached her, she seemed frightened and instinctively took a few steps back, keeping a distance from me.

She had a very attractive facial expression, was only about one meter tall, and had a slender and alluring figure. Her eyes and eyelids were large, full, and shiny, yet her head was not very big, and her eyebrows were particularly high.

Her chin, nose, and mouth are small, and her upper lip is slightly curved upward in an M shape. Her waist is extremely slender, so thin in fact, that it is extremely disproportionate to the body. It felt like it was only as thick as my arm. The hair was black, interspersed with some snow blue, like many shiny black rubber tubes, in spiralling bundles that puffed outward.

Her skin was extremely smooth and the color of her skin was pinkish-white with a hint of snow blue, or perhaps it was a reflection of the light, as she was not found to have this snow blue on many later occasions.

This pinkish-white is an extremely delicate and soft kind of pinkish-white, with a kind of diffuse reflection, unlike a mirror reflection.

The overall impression of this person is that she is: very beautiful, legs and arms, her body is extremely rounded, just like an inflatable doll. Her body structure is compact and feels like she must be the type that loves sports.

What the hell are these mysterious people? What was going on when they came to my house in the middle of the night to find me? Both fear and questions occupied my mind.

That's when I suddenly saw a strange, snow-white beam of bright light sweeping from the air to the ground, a load of silver powder was sprinkled thickly on the ground. This beam of intense light gave the impression of a very dense look, shot out when it is a section forward, retracted when it is also a section of contraction.

Objects were in the place where the light shining can be seen clearly, yet there is no scattered light around at all. This is significantly different from our common bright light. The glare we normally see is scattered light. For example, our flashlight emits a circle of light, and things within the circle of light can be seen clearly, and places outside the circle of light can barely be seen, while there is a bright column of light in the air.

This dense, intense light shines in the air, there is no bright column of light. When this dense light swept onto the branches of the trees, the branches were nevertheless clearly visible. This situation is very similar to what some UFO sightings have seen, and this light is often referred to as a cold light by UFO sightings.

Later, I learned that this cold light was accompanied by their low-powered artificial field scans that manipulate space so that the light in space rotates and advances segment by segment.

Their low-power artificial field scanning can make the dust in the air appear in an excited state without the light rays colliding with each other. As a result, this light does not have a bright column of light in the air. However, this low-power artificial field scan cannot make the ground and branches in the excited state, and can instead make the ground and branches reflective.

At that time, I looked upward with the light shining on the branches and saw a huge, black object, shaped like two straw hats together, suspended noiselessly in the air, estimated to be a few dozen meters above the ground, not far from my house. The bottom could not be seen clearly, but the rounded outline around it was clearly visible.

Strong light was coming from the bottom of this thing, and there seemed to be a row of small lights around this huge object, flashing with different colors of dark light.

Flying saucer! I exclaimed in my mind! Because I had read magazines like UFO Quest, this thing was the typical flying saucer described in the magazines.

Ah! I was shocked and immediately realized that these mysterious people might indeed be aliens.

What should I do? Runaway, scream for help, call someone for help?

Before I had time to think more, I felt as if my body had become lighter, and then quickly returned to its original state in less than a second. In a trance, I opened my eyes and saw that I was no longer outside the walls of the house and that my surroundings had suddenly changed.

I saw that I was standing in an extremely elaborate room. The room was circular in shape and seemed to be made of metal, a continuous hole with no sign of seams or assembly. The entire interior of the room was softly lit, but there were no light bulbs or anything like that visible.

The interior of the room shone with a metallic sheen, and the workmanship was extremely fine and delicate. There are not many things placed inside, and the arrangement is simple and straightforward.

In this room, or the interior of the flying saucer, no doors or windows could be seen, and there was a large pillar in the middle, which was attached to the top. The diameter is about 3 meters and the height is about 5 or 6 meters. There is a ring of raised steps at the bottom of the pillar, and the width and height of the steps are about 40 cm.

The large pillar is surrounded by a circular space in which people stay. The ring space was several tens of meters in diameter.

Although I don't remember clearly, I felt that I and a few of them came in from the center of the bottom of the saucer, as if we were sucked in by an attraction.

Near the circular metal wall, a three-dimensional image flashed up, about 70 to 80 cm above the ground. The image kept changing, like a movie, and the image could be large or small, and very realistic.

If it wasn’t so neat around the screen, like a sharp knife cut through, you would certainly think that these three-dimensional image images are in fact the real scene.

Obviously you can not see any instruments and equipment and other things, things not even similar to the shape of instruments and equipment and other. Nor is there a control panel like on our earthly spacecraft and aircraft.

I often searched online for people who had contact with aliens who were able to get into alien spaceships, and later they recalled that the alien spaceships had a large number of instruments and so on, which was clearly different from what I saw. And I remember this scene vividly.

Later I learned that all their instruments were reflected in this three-dimensional virtual image, and the control of the ship was achieved through this very image.

I saw four people with no expression and slightly trembling bodies, which I guessed were robots. Two of them came up to me and took off my sweatshirt and shorts. From then on, I was on their planet, naked until I got home.

I looked down and a slowly floating white foggy image appeared around my waist before I felt less embarrassed. I subconsciously touched my lower back with my hand and clearly felt naked.

I guess these mysterious people were really aliens, and this circular room was the flying saucer I saw in the air near my house. From the outside, the flying saucer was not very big, but from the inside, it was huge.

I was invited or abducted by them, and I was afraid that I could probably never go back home. My heart was tight, surrounded by fear and dread, and I was secretly screaming.

Soon, my suspicions were confirmed when the four robots walked in, and out of them came three real aliens. Their features had vivid expressions, and it was obvious that there were one female and two males. This female was exactly the same as the female who appeared outside the walls of my house, and I guessed then that it was the same person.

When I saw this female, I involuntarily and panic-stricken looked down at myself, because I was naked, and felt slightly safer when I saw a floating white foggy image around my waist.

The light inside the ship was strong enough to see more clearly. She was wearing a one-piece leotard, clothes, and flesh was fused together. It felt like she had no bones or muscles, or anything, her body was very enchanting and extremely streamlined, as fluid as a dolphin's body.

From the back, her hips were wide, and from the front, there was a plump bulging round thing between her legs, and I didn't know what it was.

They were all about the same height, not much difference through the naked eye, and all wore one-piece tights.

The three of them stood in a row, and the male had the same features as the woman. Large eyes, large double eyelids, small mouth, small nose, small chin, large, thin ears, and soft, delicate pinkish-white skin.
But the male aliens still clearly have some male features, and their faces are not as full and plump as the female aliens' skin, like inflatable rubber dolls. There was no bulging cylindrical thing between their legs like female aliens, and their hips were not very wide.

Their male hair was clinging to their heads like a full piece of shiny black rubber.

At a glance, these three people were obviously different to our earthly features. First, they are small, with small bodies like our children, and even like our common anime cartoon characters.

Another feature is that the human body is too delicate, as if it were an extremely well-made artificial doll, or a very well-inflated rubber doll, the height, and undulation of the facial features are not obvious, and the color of the skin is too delicate, pure, and flawless.

One of the male aliens walked up to me and pressed his right hand against his chest. It was probably their meeting ritual, like the handshake we have when we meet on Earth. The voice was not loud, and the speech was not as clear as a normal word or a sentence, but instead slurred, like the sleepy words of our earthlings, or the mumbling of a baby, and it seemed to require the aid of breathing to increase the vocalization. But the voice was soft and gentle, like the voice of a child.

I later learned that their bodies could instantly move oxygen from the outside into their bodies without the need to get oxygen through their lungs. Their lung breathing function has degraded, resulting in degraded vocal function, but they can communicate with each other without obstacles, thanks to the help of artificial field scanning information interception technology (this will be explained clearly to you later).

They use lung breathing to speak, just to serve the function of greeting. Just turn on the function of speaking, then the next communication can be all handed over to their scanning information interception system. It is equivalent to outsourcing their breathing and speaking functions.

Although I couldn't understand their language, a standard male voice immediately appeared in my ears, the specifics of which I forget now, except that I remember,
"My name is xxx (later they talked to each other, I think I heard them call him Norton, Northam, Wootton ... or something like that) I'm a biologist, I'm in charge of this trip ... we are all terrestrials, welcome to our planet Gok visit trip ... "

Later, I often heard them call their planet Gok, Gok may just be a pronunciation, sometimes I heard them call it Gork, Goq, or something like that.

I once asked them what the planet was called and where it was in the universe, but they wouldn't tell me.

I said in my mind, "You forced me to come to your ship, not that I wanted to go there on my own. But I didn't say it out loud, just an instinctive "hmmm."

Biologist Norton finished, backed out, and another male looked similar to him, but the biologist had a serious expression, while this one did not have a serious expression, but instead a cheeky demeanor, he took a step forward, walked up to me, put his right hand on his chest and said something, and immediately a standard male voice appeared in my ears, "My name is xxx (later on most occasions I heard them call him Santos, Shu Dafu ... or something like that, but sometimes it varies a lot) ... I am a physicist and welcome you to travel to our planet."

Finally, the woman took a step forward, pressed her right hand to her chest, and spoke, and immediately a sweet, soft female voice appeared in my ears,
"... My name is Willow ... (later I heard them call her Willow many times to each other, Li's voice trailed off), welcome to our planet ...."

She sounded like a child's voice but was still clearly female.

The difference between the males and females was clearly distinguishable from their vocalizations. On multiple subsequent occasions, I found that the vocal differences between females and feminine were minimal, almost the same accent, and difficult to distinguish from each other vocally. The vocal differences between males were somewhat greater, but nowhere near as pronounced as on our planet.

It seems that this is their welcome ceremony, I think they are very civilized aliens in the universe, who will not kill me, and will not dissect my body barbarically, my nervous heart was much relieved by this.

Biologist Norton with a hand on the side, immediately next to a three-dimensional virtual image appeared, Norton on it with a few hand dots, continued to speak, although I could not understand his words, but the ear seems to have a translator, and translated a standard voice to, sometimes it feels not like a voice but instead as if it is just an idea, "You are our long-term observation subject. When you were a child, you were sent to our ship many times. Your name is Chang Hsiang Chien, isn't it? According to your custom, the surrounding people should call you Chienko, right?"

"Yes, some people have called me that, but most people call me Chien," I thought to myself. "How could they possibly know my name?"

"Chien? Let's call you Chienko from now on. We invited you to our planet because we want to do two very important experiments through you, and we hope to get data that will be useful to us."
"What experiments?" I asked curiously.
"We want to study your brain and expect to find the information we need," Norton replied.

"Ah! You guys are going to cut my brain open?" I immediately tensed up inside again and blurted out.

"Hahahaha," the physicist Santos immediately burst out laughing, a laugh like our earthly laughter, with which his upper body twitched rhythmically, and the words appeared in my ears, "Only you stupid earthlings like to do that."

When I saw his laughter, I was thinking, "Isn't this movement of his, this demeanor, just like us Earthlings? They could just be dwarves from somewhere on Earth, using special clothes, or just wearing transparent, tight rubber clothes to trick me into trying to take me somewhere on Earth, so they can carry out whatever ulterior motives they might have.

But what value was there in me, that would interest them?

When I think of the thin waist of a woman named Willow, I wondered, how could an earthling have such a thin waist? How can earthlings have that kind of three-dimensional virtual image? My frustration began to rise again.

I thought this because I was actually very afraid about leaving earth, afraid that I would never be able to go home, leaving my family forever, holding on to the belief that we were still just experimenting on Earth.

"Ah, that's not going to happen," Norton reassured me.

"We'll use our Artificial Field scanning technology to study your brain, and Artificial Field can emit fields, an invisible substance in the universe, even deep inside your brain, without any effect on your brain."

"Of all the people on Earth, why is my brain special? Why am I being singled out?" I still feel puzzled, I thought to myself but did not say out loud, but biologist Norton seems to guess my mind.

"When you were a child herding geese in the fields, you encountered a particularly advanced civilization in the universe of species, their level of civilization, the degree of technological development is far higher than ours.

"If you use the time to express the level of civilization, we are the level of civilization of ten thousand years, while your Earth can only be considered the level of civilization of a thousand years, these particularly advanced civilizations of human species, their civilization is the level of ten million years, or perhaps even billion years.

"Their level of civilization and technological development, many of which we can hardly imagine, may not be defensive to your technologically backward earthlings, but they are defensive to us, and it is difficult for us to approach and understand them positively.

"The consciousness of these species, of particularly advanced civilizations in the universe, may have invaded your brain, and you may have some memories of them, and we would like to scan and record them if so. We are very eager to understand how they see the universe, what is different from us. Of course, that's just our expectation, we may not get anything, but I hope to get what we want."

I immediately remembered that time, when I was about seven or eight years old, when I was alone in the sand, herding geese.

"What do you want me to do?" I said to Norton.

"We will use our scanning technology to scan your brain in a remote, non-contact manner. All you have to do is listen to us, obey us, and cooperate with our experiments; you don't have to do anything," Norton said.

"We will allow you to visit many places on our planet. You will have many wonderful experiences that will add to the knowledge and the experience that you can't get on your own planet. Experiences that will enrich your life and that will change your destiny when you return home. You will become a rich and famous person on your planet.

"You will be the key person who will change the destiny of your planet, and in the future, you will be admired by many until the people on your planet disappear in the universe, and there will be countless who will remember your name forever. Because on your planet, you will be the first person to know the secret of time.

"In the universe, there are many highly developed civilized planets, and on whatever planet, the first person to know the nature of time is the true king of all scientists and will be worshiped as a god. They will not be forgotten until the day their civilization disappears from their planet forever.

"Why is this so? Because the nature of time is the most central secret of the universe, deciphering it is of unparalleled importance and can cause enormous changes in the entire planet that no scientific discovery can ever match.

"We will soon tell you the essence of time, although you only get this secret from us, not from your own independent thinking. However, it does not prevent you from still being the first person on your earth who really knows the secret of time without any doubt, and you earthlings may not care how you got the secret of time, and in the future, you may just rely on luck and exist as a god-like on your earth."

I was not particularly happy with what the biologist said about how I would develop in the future because my dream at that time was just to be able to marry a beautiful wife and build a big house with a big yard in my hometown. As for the secrets of time in the universe, the fate of the country, the fate of the people of Earth, and I are not a matter of eight sticks, I simply did not think about these things.

As soon as I heard that my brain was going to be scanned, I got nervous again. They seemed to immediately guess my fears.

"There will be no problem, our technology is absolutely safe!" Santos walked up to me with some mysterious look, and the words immediately appeared in my brain.
"We will also arrange a beautiful girlfriend for you during this short trip you are taking to our planet!"

As the physicist said this, his eyes glanced at Willow, who tossed his head in what seemed to be an attitude of arrogance and disdain.

"You've been asked to come here for another experiment this time," Norton continued.
"We ask you to do various sexual experiments with different women on our planet while recording your brain consciousness, various sensations, and various movements of other parts of your body, for physiological information.

"We want to convert this information into data, which is important to us and is also an important source of wealth for us. When sexual activity is transformed into data, it can be exchanged as a commodity, and you people on Earth may not understand this.

"When you were a child, we picked you up many times by spaceship, but, did not arrange for you to come to our planet because at that time, your body was not yet developed and your sexual consciousness was not yet formed. Your current age is the stage where your body and sexuality are at their strongest."

"The planet we are on is actually more than one, it is technically a galaxy with many planets around the main star, just like the solar system where your Earth is located, with many planets and moons," Santos interjected.

"There are people living on dozens of planets near our main planet, and different planets are inhabited by many different women with different external body shapes, whose weirdness you may not imagine, and you will meet them later.

"Of course, we will try our best to select some species that are close to the physical shape of the women on your planet to have a relationship with you. If the difference in the external shape of the body is too great, I doubt you won't inspire a sexual desire for their bodies.

"For example, the males on your earth may excite a little sexual desire for sows and cows, because the bodies of sows and cows are more or less close to the bodies on your earth, with some similar sexual organs. If you are faced with prawns and insects, you will not be aroused at all, sexually."

Santos's words made me worry, were they going to force me to have sex with animals like sows and cows? That would be very bad. I would consider it, if I had sex with a beautiful woman like Willow. Maybe these people are perverts and will not easily submit to my wishes.

At that moment, the two slightly trembling bodies, probably robots, came to me, one holding what was a 3-D virtual image of my house, and the other holding a 3-D image of a bottle containing a human corpse.

One of the robots said to me, "From now until the end, you will listen quietly and well, you will obey us completely, and at the end - we will send you home in one piece …" After saying that, the robot pulled the 3-D image of my house closer to me.

Another robot added, "If you disobey, resist, and disobey us, this is what will happen to you."

The robot finished putting the 3-D image of the body of a potion-soaked Earthling closer for to me to see, looking at my bones, my heart jumping. The mood was instantly tense again, and the good impression I had of them before collapsed instantly. They might after all be bad guys, and this time, I might be out of luck.

I was mentally extremely upset and intensely scared for a time. Then I managed to reassure myself that the purpose of their arresting me was to do two experiments. Scanning my brain in a non-contact way would not hurt me, right?

They want sexual data, they are telling me to have sex with different kinds of women on their planet, not to be tortured to death, right? Besides, I don't have a girlfriend right now, I have no sexual experience, and I'm sexually horny. This experiment didn't seem so bad.

"Where is your planet in the universe, is it in the galaxy? How far is it from our planet?"

"That question, as is our custom, will not be answered."

"How long must I stay on your planet?"

"About a month, according to the time you have been on Earth."

"My family will be very anxious for such a long time."

"No, our time passes differently than yours, the time you visit our planet, plus the time the ship takes to get back and forth, will not exceed one night on your planet, we will send you back before dawn and no one will find out you traveled to our planet, including your family."

I was not impressed with Norton's words. "Do you have that much power? Can you turn back time?"

"We can't do that to turn back time. But we can achieve an effect similar to turning back time by changing how fast or slow it passes.

"The speed of time passing is a comparative concept, and for different planets and different places in the universe, the speed of time passing may be different. Only when two different places are compared with each other does the speed of time passing make sense. It is meaningless to say that the speed of time passing in the same place is meaningless.

"For example, the size of an object only makes sense when comparing different objects. It is meaningless to compare the size of the same object.

"We use Artificial Field scanning technology to irradiate a certain space, which can fill the local space with an energy field for the purpose of changing the speed of time passing, and this technology can make the time passing in one place slower than another place. This is what we call the concept of time potential difference.

"Conversely, we can do the same. That is, we can make time pass faster in one place than in another.

"There is no concept of time passing faster or slower in the same place, and time reversal cannot be done because time reversal first requires that the events occur in the same region of space, in the same place. As I said, it is meaningless to compare how fast or slow time passes in the same place."

Norton patiently explained, but my mind went blank, unable to comprehend what he said.

"We can now also achieve some time-reversal phenomena in local regions of space, but only by having an event rapidly regress to a previous state and then start again; a complete, pure, progressive time-reversal phenomena, we can't do," Physicist Santos's additional explanation was even more incomprehensible to me.

"Are there any more questions?" Norton asked, staring me in the eyes, the words filtering through my ears.
"If there's nothing wrong, we'll take the ship back now."

Norton ran his hand through the air, and suddenly a white, delicate three-dimensional block of smoke appeared, then it turned back into a three-dimensional figure with some words I didn't recognize flashing on it, and Norton was manipulating it with his fingers.

A clear, standard, sweet female voice reached my ears and kept talking, and my body suddenly felt lighter, as we were flying toward their planet.
