## Chapter 5
### What Is the GPIN?

"Is your planet in the galaxy? How far is it from our planet?" I asked in my mind.

This time, the standard voice did not answer me.

Where did this voice come from? From my home on Earth, all the way to here, it seemed to always follow me, always talking in my ear. And sometimes, it seemed like it wasn't a voice, just a thought that naturally appeared in my head, not like my ears were hearing it.

Did they put a translator on me? But whose words were being translated? Who was talking to me? Or is there another me answering me?

The standard voice was silent and still did not answer me.

"Who are you, and how can you keep following me when I can't see you?" I asked in my mind.

"I am the ZITU-300 spacecraft's intelligent information service system, which can provide you with two services remotely: the frequency intercept technology we use to feed the voice signal directly to your brain, and the other is to transmit the voice to your ears."

"The voice I hear at home, is that you, too? " I asked in my head.

"Yes, the ZITU-300 spacecraft was over your house at the time and could have served you with a language message. Although you have now set foot on our planet, you are still close to the ZITU-300 spacecraft, and it is still the equipment inside the spacecraft that is providing you with the language information service.

"Our planet has two major networks, a Global Public Motion Network that allows objects and people to move around the globe at the speed of light, and a Global Public Information Network that provides information services to everyone on the planet," This standard voice said.

"As soon as you step out of this flying saucer warehouse, the intelligent information service system of the ZITU-300 spacecraft will no longer provide information services for you.

"The Global Public Information Network will take over from me to provide information services for you. And the global public information network is powerful. As long as you are on our planet, it can provide you with at least four kinds of information services:

"One is the use of frequency intercept technology to deliver sound information directly to your brain.

"One is the use of frequency intercept technology to deliver three-dimensional image information directly to your brain.

"One is artificial field scanning technology to remotely create sound delivery to your ears. 

"One uses artificial field scanning technology to remotely create three-dimensional images to appear before your eyes. 

All of these are delivered remotely and in a non-contact manner."

Later, I learned that their global public information network was equivalent to our Internet and that each of their brains could connect directly to the global public information network. Their global public information network could transmit information over long distances through space. In this way, the people on their planet can always be connected to the global information network and the global motion network without interference.

So they don't need to learn a lot of things. When they need to know something, they search directly through their brain into the global information network. It's the same information we have online now. Especially with some rote knowledge, they didn't need to learn at all. They don't have teachers and don't have places like our schools.

For some flexible and creative knowledge, they use the so-called "interception" technique. That is, they use the scanning technology of artificial fields to transfer information from outside the human brain to inside the human brain in a non-contact way. The recipient lies in bed and wakes up with a lot of knowledge.

With their interceptor technology, they can also travel virtually, fall asleep in bed, watch movies with their eyes closed, play games, communicate with friends in distant places, etc.

Through their frequency intercept technology, they can even lie in bed and engage in virtual sexual activities with distant friends of the opposite sex.
