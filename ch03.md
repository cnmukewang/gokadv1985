### FTL Communication on Planet Gok
 
We were silent for a while, and I suddenly remembered something, so I asked, "How do you pilot your flying saucers?"
 
"The speed of the flying saucers is too fast for human pilots. Our saucers are computer pre-programmed to drive," Santos said.
 
"Not only is the space-time inside the saucer different from the space-time outside, but the space-time in the area where the piloting part of the saucer is located is also different from the other areas of the saucer.
 
"If our flying saucer wants to fly to a certain planet, we need to measure the distance and coordinates of this planet and our planet in advance, use the movement time of the saucer to control the flight distance, and set the piloting program to get there.
 
"When the saucer reaches your planet, we put the saucer in the quasi-excited state to make it stop. Then we make the saucer switch to the excited state and fly up at the speed of light, but the set time is very short, so the saucer only flies a short distance and then switches back to the quasi-excited state.
 
"This constant switching of the space-time state of the saucer would allow the saucer to fly past your earth at an arbitrary speed well below the speed of light."
 
"Then this measurement of yours must be very accurate. If the measurement is wrong, will the flying saucer have an accident?" I asked.
 
"That's for sure, if the measurement is not accurate, the flying saucer will crash just like the airplanes on your Earth, and it will also be destroyed.
 
"We first use a set of computer programs to control the flying saucer to approach your planet at the speed of light, and when it is close to your planet, we let the flying saucer switch the space-time state and continue to your planet at a speed far below the speed of light," Santos said.
 
"However, such measurements are not a difficult task for us. The most advanced thing you have on earth is the laser, and we use the field to measure. You earthlings measure with lasers, which are considered the most advanced. We measure with fields, the essence of which is to change the cylindrical spiral motion of space. Measuring with fields is much more advanced than lasers.
 
"Measurement involves the transfer of information. You earthlings, use lasers to measure the distance between the moon and the earth, which requires the laser to reflect back to determine it. This method has an apparent drawback, the laser cannot be emitted to planets far away from your planet due to energy dissipation, plus the laser has a finite rate of emission and reflection.
 
"With our artificial field scanning, the energy dissipation is zero, and not only can it be emitted to very distant planets, but the field can also move at superluminal speeds. The nature of the field is immaterial space and can be so without the restriction of objects that cannot move faster than the speed of light.
 
"Not only can we now use the field to measure the distance and direction of distant planets, but we can also use the field to observe these distant planets, and we can also use artificial field scanning to communicate with each other, and human field scanning communication is far superior to lasers and electromagnetic waves.
 
"For example, if people on earth drive a car and use electromagnetic waves to communicate, it is basically possible because the speed of electromagnetic waves is the speed of light, which is far faster than the speed of a car. 
 
"It would be a joke if we drove a light-speed flying saucer through the universe and then used light-speed electromagnetic waves to communicate with each other. So, FTL artificial field scanning communication is our ideal and only option."
 
"On your planet, do you also use artificial field scanning to communicate with each other?" I asked.
 
"That's for sure, on our planet, we all use artificial field scanning to communicate, and the advantages of human field communication are incomparable to electromagnetic wave communication," Santos said.
 
"For example, in a very deep underground coal mine on your planet, there was a mining accident, and the mine passage was buried by a thick layer of earth. The electromagnetic wave signals on your planet could not penetrate the thick layer of earth and could no longer communicate with the outside world. However, if it was us. We would use the field as a medium to communicate, and the nature of the field is space, and space as a medium can pass through the whole planet without such barriers.
 
"For example, we probe the earth's interior and predict earthquakes, and artificial field scans come in handy. The information propagated by the field is not only penetrating; but almost nothing can be blocked. The energy dissipation during propagation is minimal, and the attenuation is also small and can even reach zero, which can also spread to a very long distance. 
 
"Energy is required only for signal generation and reception; long-distance propagation does not consume energy. Information field propagation has the distinct advantage of being faster than electromagnetic waves, and in theory, it can reach almost infinite speeds.
 
"The speed of electromagnetic wave propagation is the speed of light. According to your earth's theory of relativity, the fastest speed of motion in the universe is the speed of light. Space propagation of information can exceed the speed of light; how is this?
 
"Space is a special kind of matter that is very different from ordinary object particles, which have mass and charge. The speed of motion of ordinary objects cannot exceed the speed of light because the speed of ordinary object particles approaches the speed of light, and their mass tends to infinity.
 
"The nature of electromagnetic waves and light is the accelerated motion of charge, which creates an anti-gravitational field that causes charge particles, generally electrons, to lose their mass and charge properties, and also be in an excited state, moving at the speed of light.
 
"The nature of light is also an object particle. Its fluctuation is the fluctuation of space itself because space is always moving at the speed of light, and light is practically stationary in space. Moving with the speed of light is space. Its speed cannot exceed the speed of light, just as long as it is an object particle, as its natural state of motion cannot exceed the speed of light. However, space, because it has no mass and no charge, unlike ordinary objects, is not subject to this constraint on its speed of motion."
 
"Using fields for communication is a top-notch way to do this," Norton said.
 
"Because the universe is made up of only two things, object particles and space, any way of using object particles to communicate and process information is backward; using space to transmit information is the most advanced."
 
"Not only are we using space to transmit information on our planet, but we're using space to process the information on a large scale," Santos said.
 
"Our computers and the global public information network are like your computers on earth and the Internet you have built; our computers are virtual, and the public information network relies primarily on space to transmit information. We can make all our brains connected to other people and the public information network through space at all times without any interference through the scanning technology of the artificial field.
 
"Therefore, we do not need other devices, such as computers and cell phones, to access the Internet to communicate and connect with other people.
 
"We now store information also using space, and there is a fundamental theorem about space and information in our concept of the spatial information field of the universe.
 
"Any space in the universe can store all the information of the entire universe, from the past to the future. In other words, the capacity of space to store information is theoretically infinite.
 
"In practice, the ability of space to store information is constrained by some other conditions. Although it is not infinite, the ability of space to store information is also very frightening in the eyes of your earthlings.
 
"Of course, you earthlings at this stage only know that visible and tangible things like oil, coal, and metals are important and valuable. Not realizing that data is also important and that, in fact, information and data are even more valuable.
 
"Sooner or later, you earthlings will also realize the mysteries hidden in space and use space on a large scale to disseminate and process information, and store data.
 
"Especially in the era of mass interstellar travel, after you earthlings can develop light speed vehicles, it must be a joke if light speed vehicles have to use traditional light speed electromagnetic waves to communicate.
 
"A light-speed vehicle must have this instantaneous arrival, near the infinite speed of motion mode of communication, that is, using the movement of space itself, similar to the quantum entanglement kind of mode of your earth's quantum mechanics," He concluded.
 
After about an hour or so, I saw the three-dimensional image inside the ship suddenly disappear. The red, slightly swaying robot body suddenly shrank to a single piece, becoming very small, it turned purple, then scattered like liquid droplets on the ground, and finally burrowed into the ship's interior and disappeared.
 
That mysterious standard voice appeared in my head again (not in my ears, but I felt it), "Planet Gok is here. Let's go down now".
 
This soft female voice kept talking along the way and seemed to be introducing something.
 
Before I knew it, we had arrived at their planet. Several of them stood up, "The flight is over, we have arrived at our planet, let's go down."
