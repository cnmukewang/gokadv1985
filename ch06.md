## Chapter 6
### Stepping Onto the Streets of Alien Planet

We came out of the flying saucer warehouse and didn't take a few steps when suddenly the surroundings changed drastically, and a street of their planet's city appeared instantly. I fixed my eyes, and to my surprise, their planet was not at all what I had imagined.

It seems to me that there are extraordinarily long buildings everywhere, and some houses are so long you can't see the end of them. I don't think they should be built that long. They should be separated in the middle so that pedestrians and vehicles can walk easily. Why do they do this?

Everything on the street is neat and simple. The houses are elegant and simple in style, even the roads are clean and tidy, without any flaws. The road was green. I don't know what kind of material it was made of. It looked like it was made of plastic.

There were many odd-shaped plants on both sides of the road, planted in rows, incredibly neatly.

There were no cars of any style, and no vehicles in sight. There were no power lines, no airplanes in the air, and certainly no flying saucers for them. The flying saucers were probably too fast to be seen. Nor were there any kind of stores, hotels or anything like that in sight.

Many of those tall houses are like flying saucer warehouses with virtual walls, some obviously look like real buildings, yet these are not as tall as the virtual ones.

The walls of the virtual houses have windows and doors of the same size and different colors, and their locations also happen to coincide with the location of the windows and doors. I reckon these others colored areas on the walls are the windows and doors of the virtual houses.

Some houses have no doors or windows, and some are suspended in the air alone, without any support below. Many of the houses high above the ground were inverted triangles, some so high that they seemed in space. Some houses had huge, probably their words floating alone above them, similar to the English language, without any connection to the house.

I think I really set foot on an alien planet for once, and it could never be somewhere on Earth. There is no such place in any country. Not even the movies have ever seen a place like this. The little illusion left in my mind (that this time it might still be somewhere on Earth) was completely shattered.

However, instead, much of the tension and anxiety I was feeling was released, and I was happy to be here as it was.

The typical male speech in my head abruptly changed into a charming and exceedingly feminine (arguably flirty to the extreme, later realizing that this voice was synthesized by their artificial intelligence, not a natural person's voice) female voice at that point.

"Welcome, Earth's Chienko to visit and travel in the Gok galaxy, the Gok galaxy global public information network intelligent system attentively at your service."

According to the current understanding, this female voice is equivalent to our mobile network artificial intelligence customer service, and this global public information network is equivalent to our Earth's Internet.

Suddenly, a three-dimensional virtual image appeared in front of me, and an extremely beautiful and somewhat slutty alien girl continued in an extremely charming voice,

"Chienko will visit the planet Gok, which is a highly virtualized planet and a horny one (why does she say horny? I didn't hear or understand it wrong, right? I'm thinking). I am Karen (phonetic), the personal private service of Planet Gok's global public information network. I will do my best to provide information services for Chienko. No matter what kind of environment Chienko is in, you will be served by Karen's attentive and safe service. I am your lovely ..."

The girl said the words while her body was getting smaller and smaller, closer and closer to me, and her clothes were slowly melting. Finally, the three-dimensional image seemed to disappear into my chest. Strangely enough, there seemed to be a feeling in my body at the time, as if I smelled the body odor of a girl. Was this not a purely virtual image?

Since I was naked, I subconsciously looked at my waist the white foggy virtual image was still there, and I felt a little more grounded.

Why did she say that Planet Gok was a lusty planet? Is there such a way to introduce yourself of your home?

I subconsciously ran my hands in my ears a few more times. I thought, "Is there a translator in my ear? " Turns out there was nothing. 

I noticed that the planet was particularly sunny. But the sun wasn't warm when it shone on me. The various scenes were exceptionally bright and visibility was good. It felt like the scenes in the distance looked very clear. The plants were also predominantly green, but significantly darker than those on our planet.

I later learned that their planet also revolves around a luminous star. The stellar energy that this planet is exposed to is significantly less than the sunlight energy that our Earth receives. Plants have evolved over time to be brightly colored, which increases the efficiency of photosynthesis in plants.

Their landscape looks very bright, and I later learned that the reason is caused by the fact that they have very little dust and particulate matter in the air.

They cover the ground entirely, and the roots of the plants are wrapped with special materials at the junction of the ground. In their urban areas, the ground is all covered with something like plastic. This material is more advanced than our cement, very hard-wearing and flexible, resulting in very little dust.

In their wilderness, there is no desert or anything like that. The vegetation is magnificent. The rivers are dammed with artificial structures.

Not only do they not allow dust to be released into the air, but they have special vacuum systems that work constantly.

Their industries use artificial field to scan cold processes, there are no smokestacks, and most industries are set on another industrial planet.

In addition, they have tens of billions of people worldwide, sharing common transportation - A global public motion network that can appear anywhere on the globe in a second by sending their movement request. As a result, they don't have cars, trains, planes, and other vehicles running around, making smog and dust.

They are doing an unbelievably good job of protecting the environment.

But for us earthlings, they tell me that your immune function will be severely degraded if you live up there for a long time. It's just that their people don't care about this, and their medical care is so advanced that they can efficiently deal with this problem.

There are not many pedestrians on their streets, walking in twos and threes, unhurriedly. Some carried nothing and walked in the air in a cruising position, about a meter above the ground.

I also noticed that these people were clearly male and female, all about a meter tall, all about the same age, young and beautiful, and none of the elderly or babies.

When I saw their crowd, the first feeling was like seeing our kindergarten after school. Their people were too short.

These people are exquisite, their skin is fine and soft, without blemishes. The skin glow appears to be diffuse, not the mirror-reflected kind.

Later I learned that their people could retouch their appearance remotely with the help of their global public motion network and global information network. Like our current TikTok open beauty face, what I saw of their appearance was not entirely natural.

These women's clothes seem to blend with the body, wearing a very simple style, usually bare arms, the upper body a tight sweatshirt, very snug, as if the naked upper body painted color only, even the lower body a small skirt-like thing. The clothes are very exposed, is for summer wear.

Some of them, the clothes' pattern on their bodies is constantly changing, just like our TV screens.

These people almost always walk barefoot. The women's hair was usually draped outward, coiled in bundles, while the men's hair was usually tightly barred on their heads, and the hair was of various colors, generally very bright.

I also found a phenomenon, these people are walking empty-handed, that is, women did not bring any bags and other things, this is why? I could not understand at that time.

I also noticed a phenomenon that, regardless of gender, many people walking, a three-dimensional image will emerge from the side of the shoulder or head. The content of this image is bizarre; some like small animals, some like words, some like complex machines, some do not know what type, some patterns are still changing.

I was curious in my mind, what was floating above the heads of these people?

"This is an artificial field scanning remote virtual imaging technology to get. It is a kind of signature, label, a self-presentation, labeling, and also the meaning of indicating and showing one's personality," That public information network of customer service staff Karen explained to me.

But I still didn't quite understand and continued to ask Willow about them.

"Ah, you can say it's a kind of pet, representing a person's mood. It can be changed. Today this pattern floats on your head; tomorrow, it may float another pattern," Willow gave me an answer, but I still didn't quite understand.

"Ahhhhh, I can't understand. I can only guess that the patterns on these people's heads are just your personal preferences to show off yourself. There is no real purpose," I said.

"What do you think of the air on our planet?" Santos asked.

"It's good," I said, my attention shifting to the air and feeling refreshed."Your air has a higher oxygen content than our planet, right?"

"Yes, 23.18 percent," Santos said. "The key thing that works is the negative ions and some other gases in the air, and your planet's air is kind of bad. We have tried higher oxygen levels before and found that organisms, many of the human body, could not adapt, and after repeated tests, it was determined that this oxygen level was the best."

Norton faced me and said, "How about we go back to our quarters now and show you around our planet in detail later?"

"Okay, how far is your residence from us?"

"In your Earth's unit of length, it's about 10,000 kilometers."

"And what kind of transportation do we take to get there, or do we take a flying saucer?"

No one answered me, and Norton put his hands up and jerked his ears. I heard the gentle voice of Karen, the global information network customer service, "Requesting appendage teleportation, type: alien biotic."

I felt a lightness in my body and then quickly returned to my original state. My ears heard them say at the same time, "We're home!"

More than 10,000 kilometers, so fast? So easy to reach their residence? What kind of transportation did they use? More advanced than a flying saucer?

I did not see anything, just see Norton's hand waving. My heart is full of questions.
