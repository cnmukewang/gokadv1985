### Why Do Gok Aliens Want to Abduct Earthlings?

I wanted to change the subject, so I asked Norton, "Have you seen our Earthling women? Do you think our Earthling women are beautiful?"

Norton said, "We have abducted you earthlings many times, just I alone have been there many times, so of course, I know you earthlings very well.

"Not only do we often go to our planet to abduct people, but we also often go to other planets far away in the universe to abduct people to our Gok Galaxy.

"In our eyes, according to our aesthetic habits, the women on your planet are not considered beautiful compared to the women on other planets."

"Then why are you going to kidnap people from Earth?" I asked rhetorically.

"It has nothing to do with being beautiful. We don't go to an alien planet to abduct people just because they are beautiful," Norton said.

"If we go to your Earth and abduct an Earth person, our main purpose is to obtain information data about the Earth person's mind and consciousness, memory, senses, various movements, physiological activities, etc.

"Through our technical means, we can make our people have the same feelings and experiences as your earthlings, and this effect is equivalent to replacing our body with your earthling's body and let us live for a while."

"Then why do you want to replace your bodies with Earthling's bodies to live for a period of time?" I asked, "Is it because Earthling bodies are good?"

Norton replied, "You earthlings are after material wealth and power. We are not interested in these, we are after human experiences and feelings, and by living in an Earthling body instead, we can experience what it is like to be an Earthling.

"We often go to other planets to abduct people so that we can often switch to the bodies of people on other planets to live and experience for a period of time. Your earthling's bodies seem to us to be very poor and nothing special.

"For all people in the universe, the three survival elements are material resources, energy, and information.

"We have advanced technology. Material resources and energy are free, so we don't care.  We are only interested in information, and acquiring information is our main thing.

"The acquisition of wealth through information data, called the information data economy, accounts for about ninety-nine percent of our economy, even more. On our planet, material resources and energy are almost free.

"Abducting people from other planets or abducting you earthlings, the information obtained from the Earthlings can bring us great wealth.

"For example, if we take a person from Earth to our planet, we can force this person to do various sexual activities with women of different in this galaxy. Then we record detailed data about this Earthling's body, physiology, mind-consciousness, senses and memory, and various other actions, which can create a lot of wealth for us.

"After obtaining this data, we can advertise and sell it on our global information network under the name of 'making love and living with earthlings' and then sell it to many users.

"For example, after purchasing the data of 'making love and living with earth men' one of our female users, with the help of our virtual technology, a three-dimensional virtual image of an earthman follows this female like a shadow. This woman lives as if she were living with a real Earthman, can chat, interact, and even engage in virtual sexual activity.

"In addition to this 3D virtual companionship technology, we also have a popular 3D physical companionship technology.

"For example, one of our female users can activate a gelatinous substance after purchasing data on 'making love and living with an earthling' This substance is activated by this data information. It quickly becomes active, and instantly a person with the exact same appearance, height, and weight as this Earthling appears around. Moreover, there is no difference in sight, touch, and taste. Then, our female user can live with the Earthling for a period of time like a real earthling.

"The user can talk, communicate, and even have sex with the person turned by the gelatinous substance, and the sensation is no different from that of a real person. Of course, this person formed by the gelatinous substance is not a simple robot. Its ideology and behavior are determined by the data information purchased by the user.

"If you earthlings catch one alien, at most, take turns having sex with a few earthwomen a few times. It is unlikely that it will become as quickly and widely popular in society as we are. With this technology means we can do it so that one Earthling can live with tens of thousands of women from the planet Gok and have sex at the same time.

"We also have very perverted users who make the body of a simulated Earthman very small and parasitize it in their own body and carry it around with them, or make the body of a simulated Earthman very large and parasitize their own body in the body of an Earthman. Or transform the simulated Earthling into a pet-like form. The ways are varied and strange, with all kinds of weird habits and perverted behaviors, far beyond your imagination, that you may encounter later.

"The beauty of the data economy is that it does not satisfy just one of our women but thousands of our women simultaneously. Thousands of our women can buy data on 'sex and life with earth men', and all can live together for a long time as if they were with real earth men. It also depends on how popular 'sex and life with earth men' data is on our planet.

"For every new alien species, we discover and successfully abduct, 'data on living with this new alien species' will be popular in our society for a while. It is like a popular song on your planet. The main factors are novelty and authenticity, not exactly good or bad quality.

"For example, we can also design data of an earthling out of thin air, but such data will not sell well in the market even if the user experience is good because the users think that all these data are fake, and we made them up of thin air.

"Now we really kidnapped you, a human being, back from the Earth, and the data generated, plus we will take you Chienko around in the future, will arouse the interest of many users.

"We also have people who want to buy the human body data of your Earthling. After you buy it, you can save your own Gok's body in the space-time refrigerator and then apply for an artificially created body, the same as your Earthling's, injected with your Earthling's human data. Then you can live with  earthling body for a period of time so that you can gain the experience of living as an earthling."

"So you see, it's a good deal for us to kidnap you," Santos said with a somewhat wry smile. "Unfortunately, your Earthling data, which has a low prevalence rate on our planet, is considered to be pretty garbage."

"Then why did you kidnap us Earthlings and kidnap me?" I complained to.

"They said that in your brain, there seems to be something special," Willow said slowly.

"So, did you send back all the Earthlings you kidnapped?" I asked.

"Some were sent back; some were not physically strong and died on the spot while doing experiments; some couldn't stand having sex with the women of our Gok planet and were abused to death; some ended up dying of old age on our Gok planet. Why? you may ask," Santos shook himself and said with a smile, "Because we are lazy too!"

Seeing my face and look wrong, Willow hurriedly reassured me and said, "We will definitely send you back to Earth. You have a special place in your brain that is different from those normal people and is important to us."

Later I learned that they abducted people from particularly developed alien planets but served them carefully, probably for fear of retaliation. To us earthlings, they are disposed of as they wish, because we earthlings are powerless against them.
