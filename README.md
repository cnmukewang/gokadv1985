## BOOK: A True Story: Chang Hsiang Chien’s Adventures on the Alien Planet Gok in 1985: A Chinese farmer abducted to an alien planet for a month brings back never-before-seen secrets

## FOREWORD

This is the true story of a Chinese farmer who was abducted to an alien planet for a month in 1985. He was 19 years old, very youthful, and very strong. His name was Chang Hsiang Chien, and he lived in a village in Lujiang County, Anhui Province, China.

The alien planet was called Gok and his abductors were a small alien species - about 1 meter tall, with smooth skin, refined appearance, highly developed technology, and advanced physical field control techniques.

Contrary to the information we usually get, these aliens usually have no noble purpose in abducting earthlings, instead doing so purely for entertainment. They collect information about intelligent life on Earth, and other planets, and use this information to create virtual playmates for the entertainment of alien men and women. Most people on their planet have nothing better to do than to play all day. Only a very small number of people are engaged in science and research.

During a month of contact, the aliens showed Chang advanced field control technology, shocking human factories, and immortality technology, virtual people and virtual entertainment, bizarre alien natural environments, and even more bizarre alien social morality and order... In fact, aliens have no morality, but they can live in harmony with each other with the help of high technology.

At the same time, Chang, as a research subject, is subjected to cruel treatment by the aliens, including sexual abuse by various creatures, exposing the ugly, cruel, indifferent, and lascivious dark side of the aliens under the surface of advanced technology.

Fortunately, Chang had experiences with more advanced aliens in his childhood, and these memories were valuable to these aliens. As a result, they developed a good relationship with Chang. With the help of the aliens' extremely advanced medical technology, Chang was able to return to Earth in a healthy and fully intact. Also, with the help of these aliens, some key information about their advanced technology was successfully brought back.

The alien secrets brought back by Chang are highly innovative and enlightening. This included the principle of light-speed flying saucers. The principle is to protect the occupants under ultra-mobility. Other secrets included: The principle of alien global instantaneous transfer technology, the alien planet political order, and the principles of alien immortality technology. In particular, the secrets of cosmic physics, and the secrets of time … were revealed to him by the aliens. All of these were previously unheard of.

These extremely advanced cutting-edge technologies and principles are refreshing. It could bring fundamental progress and change to human society.

Again, this is not a science fiction novel, but a true story. But the truth is often more absurd than fiction.


## PREFACE
When I was about seven or eight years old, I drove the geese to the beach by the river and let them go find something to eat, and suddenly I saw several aerosol-like objects moving quickly in front of my eyes, and one of them was rushing towards me. I suddenly felt a humming sound in my head, my eyes darkened, and I squatted down involuntarily. It took me a long time to wake up, and for the mist in front of my eyes to disappear completely.

I didn't see the flying saucer either. I just saw a red light flashing in the west sky. It was about four or five o'clock, between the afternoon and the evening. The red light appeared close to the sun, and there was also another light near the sun at that time. There were many red clouds, so I didn’t know if they were flying saucers at the time.

This was one of the strangest things I encountered when I was a kid, and I still remember it fondly.

Since I was about twelve or thirteen years old, I have been dreaming at night that I live on another planet. The sun does not seem to be very strong on this planet, and the light is bluish. There are almost no plants and it seems uninhabitable on the surface, with people living deep underground. These people take extremely fast transportation and can quickly go back and forth above ground and underground.

The deepest impression in my mind is that there are a large number of big and complex buildings on the planet, both above and below ground. Most of these buildings are made of lead grey metal, and the color of the entire planet is monotonous and dull.

It's not surprising that a person occasionally has such a dream, but having had it for several years, and the dream state is sometimes very clear, I have to consider the reasons behind it all.

I encountered strange things many times when I was a child, and now, I guess that I met aliens.

Especially when I was young, I had severe nephritis. At that time, my family was extremely poor and often went hungry. Some members of the family even starved to death, including 5 out of 6 people in my mother's and 2 out of 9 people in my father's family. At that time, I didn’t have the money to go to the hospital for treatment. The aliens saved me when I was dying. This memory is very deep.

There was also an eye disease, which was very serious and lasted for half a year, but I never received any treatment for it. Only my mother came to help me occasionally. When I couldn't open my eyes, she smeared them with saliva. It worked at first, but not for long.

She didn't even have a cent to take me to the hospital for treatment. At that time, families were extremely poor, people were very ignorant, and numb. Many children died, and the level of grief among family members was not as good as the death of a kitten or puppy now.

In the end, I was almost blind, I couldn't walk at all, I could only sit by the bed all day, but then a mysterious group of people came and healed my eyes.

When I was young, I was taken away by these mysterious people many times. At the time, when I saw them, I didn't feel any fear in my heart. Every time these mysterious people came, I had a strong premonition, and I said in my heart, they were coming, they were coming, and they really came.

When they arrived, the first thing they saw was the redness of the wall. They all took me away from the bed at night, then went straight through the wall, before bringing me back in the morning, back to my bed. I also once wondered if this was a dream.

One time, when they sent me back, I told them to put me on a haystack in front of the village's cow barn. The next day, I really did fall asleep on the haystack. When I got up and went home, my mother was already up and opened the door. She was sweeping the floor and didn’t ask me where I had been.

Years later, I wondered in my heart if all that happened when I was a child was just a dream? However, the fact that I was sleeping on a haystack was absolutely true, which made me firmly reject the idea that these encounters were dreams.

In the early summer of 1985, I was 19 years old. I met aliens and traveled to their planets for a month. But, on our planet, one month is just one night, as their time is not the same as ours.

This time my memory is also not very clear, it may be that the memory is disturbed by them. However, since I am an adult, I have a certain amount of thinking and judgment, and the amount of information I get on an alien planet is huge.

Before that, I read magazines related to alien abductions. When I was 19 years old, when I first came into contact with aliens, I vaguely realized that these strange people might be aliens.

I gained a lot of valuable information from this trip, and it also had a huge impact on my future life. Otherwise, I’m just an ordinary farmer with a bit of a conservative mindset. Life would be about marrying a wife and having children, merely living a normal life. It’s impossible for me to be able to write so many articles on the Internet, especially about the mysteries of the universe, space and time, and cutting-edge physics.

I study very hard and diligently, but my grades are just average. When the junior high school graduates take the high school entrance examination, they first need to take the pre-examination. After passing the pre-examination, they are then eligible for the official high school entrance examination. Unfortunately, I didn't pass the preliminaries and after a year of re-reading, I still failed to pass the preliminaries. My father was very disappointed in me and hit me with a carrying pole.

I didn't get into high school, so I had to drop out of school and go home to farm. Since then, I have been busy with my livelihood, often working during the day, fishing at night, and hardly ever touched a book.

At that time, it was impossible to buy books in rural areas, especially textbooks above high school level. In the nearby Sanhe Town there were no textbooks available, instead there were only study guide materials below high school, as well as some books for entertainment.

I still don't know how I got this knowledge about the mysteries of the universe and cutting-edge physics, but it is definitely related to aliens.

On our planet, when a person goes out for a trip and comes back again, he then recalls the journey, usually in chronological order, and the pictures of the travel experience will appear one by one in his mind, like a movie.

However, the picture memories of my trip on this occasion are discontinuous, and the sequence of time may have been disrupted. Not knowing which things happened first and which things happened later.

On their planet, one second you may be in a horrific scene with death threats, the next, their vehicle, the highly intelligent Global Public Motion Network, can automatically transport you to a safe, soft, and comfortable bed. Even the process of entering and leaving the door is omitted.

Their society is highly virtualized, which often makes it difficult for me to distinguish between which are virtual scenes and which are real. Sometimes the real scene and the virtual scene can be switched at will.

As in, you were definitely in a virtual scene, and somehow it suddenly became a real one.

It is different from ordinary encounters with aliens. This time, from the contact I had with aliens, I obtained a lot of information about them, especially scientific and technical information. The way to communicate and learn.

It feels as if I have communicated with the consciousness of the aliens, as if the consciousness of an alien has somehow entered my consciousness, and I have part of an aliens memory, which I later mastered by slowly recalling it.

It may also be the reason why they use an artificial field scanning technique to input a lot of information into my brain through the invisible substance of the field, just like with our computer downloads. They used artificial field equipment to scan my brain and body many times, whether it was sending knowledge to my brain or doing other experiments, I do not know.

However, the memory information I have obtained, especially the memory pictures, is very large, and the concatenation makes this memory information very valuable. Of course, there are also many secrets that I have not yet been able to explain myself.

I just came back from an alien planet, I still remember many of their physical formulas and mathematical equations, I wrote them down with an exercise book, but unfortunately it was torn to shreds by my brother. There is only a little bit left, where is the rest? I asked my brother, but he ignored me. The little bit that was left was later lost as well.

It has been 37 years now, the scientific theories of aliens, I just remember some language descriptions, and also remember some important physical equations, such as the grand unified equation that writes the four forces in one equation, the generalized momentum equation, mass, charge the definition equations, etc., many of the rest are now forgotten.

I encountered an alien incident. After I posted it online, many people paid attention to it. Shanghai Baoshan TV Station interviewed me, but the program was not reviewed and was not able to be broadcast on TV.

More than ten years ago, I posted about my encounters with aliens on the Internet, one after the other, and I have always wanted to write about my travel experiences to alien planets. However, at that time I was so busy with my livelihood that I had little time to surf the Internet. Just time for a brief description of my experience on an alien planet and then post it online.

During this period, I received warning calls and verbal warnings from the relevant units, requesting that my travels to alien planets be written in science fiction and not in the form of reports of real events, so as not to cause unnecessary panic among the public.

So, a few years ago I wrote Adventures on the Planet of Gok in science fiction form.

In order to be able to post it online to find potential readers, I had to revise it. After the revision was beyond recognition, it was reluctantly posted online. Now almost all of it has been deleted from the Internet.
Many netizens were dissatisfied with this and asked me to write about a month's travel experience on a real alien planet.

Our current environment does not allow the dissemination of such information, and it is more strictly controlled than in previous years. In response to spreading this information, I have been summoned and dealt with by the police many times.

They also asked me once to write a pledge that I would not publish these articles online in the future. I agreed to make the guarantee at the time, and it is likely that the guarantee is still in their hands. It's possible that the warranty was printed by them, and I signed it, which I don't remember very well.

The police came to search my files and checked the information on my mobile phone, which brought fear to my family and made my mother-in-law cry. My wife and I have had many violent arguments about this. She scolded me for posting such nonsense information on the Internet.

My encounter with aliens was disclosed on the Internet, and some netizens were influenced by a single message for a long time, forming a stubborn and rigid thinking, unable to accept this incident, and extremely disgusted and rejected.

Due to the reports of many netizens, some people insisted on reporting me for more than ten years, which led to many websites blocking me, even my Sina blog was blocked, as well as many important articles on the frontier physical theory of aliens. Due to not having backups, this loss creates irreparable damage.

Frequent reports have led to my WeChat being blocked on a number of occasions. Now my WeChat is often threatened with being reported. Some functions of WeChat are still limited, and WeChat Pay is often blocked. My current Douyin account is still restricted because there are too many people reporting it.

On an alien planet, the thing I encountered the most was being sexually assaulted, and I remembered it clearly. Moreover, their sexual methods are extremely perverted in the eyes of us earthlings. If these aspects are completely written, it may not be tolerated by our society. Therefore, although there are many contents in this aspect that I remember very clearly, it is inconvenient to write them all, just some typical ones.

On the alien planet, they also talked about aliens lurking on earth, the future of the earthlings, some predictions about the future of earth, the future direction of China, the appearance of political figures and saints, and other sensitive content.

I want to wait until I am recognized by society and have a certain popularity and social status before I consider writing this content out completely. Writing now, I am incapable of protecting myself and my family, putting myself and them at great risk. So, this book still doesn't cover those aspects.

The book is expected to be released overseas, so as much as possible allow for real travel experiences.

In the process of traveling to an alien planet, due to many things that I cannot explain or understand, my memory is vague, and there are some problems that cannot be explained clearly. I hope readers can understand.

I also hope that some readers can look at this matter with an open and inclusive attitude, and don’t blindly accuse, abuse, or report things that they cannot accept.

Think about it, among billions of people in the world, and China has the largest population, why don't a few people encounter strange things?

In introducing the life of aliens, this article discloses many details that people didn't know about before, which can satisfy the public's curiosity about real aliens and their daily lives, and at the same time, it can also provide revelation and inspiration to the majority of scientific researchers.

After reading this book, I believe that everyone will have a general understanding of the technology and life of highly developed alien planets, the social structure, the ethics and morality of aliens, and the internal and external structures of alien bodies.

Searching the internet now, there are very few people in the world who claim that they have been to alien planets, not many people at all. But their descriptions of their travels on alien planets are completely different to mine. It may be that some of these people are lying, some may have their memories severely disturbed, misled by aliens, or just encountered different kinds of aliens.

After returning from an alien planet, I was deeply shocked and vaguely aware that alien technology could cause earth-shaking changes. At that time, I was crazy to publicize this matter. Crazy to write letters to the relevant units, it is estimated that thousands of letters have been written in the past few decades, and there are only a few replies. Most of the replies contain cold words such as: "this matter has nothing to do with us". 

I also went to the relevant units with the documents, but they didn't read my documents at all, and they didn't listen to my explanation.

Some netizens said that these people may not be able to accept the fact that a farmer encounters aliens, thinking that it is too absurd.

In fact, in many cases, I didn't even mention the alien thing at all. Sometimes, I didn't speak up, maybe they saw my clothes were not good, and they told me to get out!

The Internet spread to the countryside, and I moved to the Internet to use my spare time to research and promote alien technology. I have been persistent with this for 37 years.

It is a pity that it has not been able to attract the attention of society. This is not only a lot of netizens, but I am also puzzled, especially now that we are in the Internet age.

I plan to continue to write articles on the Internet, write science fiction novels, and strive to become famous. Once I become famous, the advanced technology of artificial field scanning for aliens that I bring will be 100% valued by society, even if some people are not happy, but no one can be blocked.

This may be the only way for me to succeed. Many netizens suggested that I conduct experiments. Of course, I will not give up on experiments. Now I have partnered with netizens to conduct experiments. It's just that I have an intuition that our conditions are crude and the experiment is unlikely to succeed.
