## Chapter 4
### Arrival at the UFO Depot on Planet Gok
 
I was excited and found myself imagining what the planet would look like. I thought it must be very prosperous with its highly developed technology. The streets must have been extremely congested and busy. People must be dressed in the most fashionable, even exotic, attire possible. The structures must be magnificent, tall, and expansive. There are a variety of strange cars on the road. Perhaps even automobiles flying through the air.
 
Would there be any big leaders on this planet to greet us? Or maybe some massive welcome party?
 
We didn't step off the ship, we just felt our bodies float up, and we left the ship, and the scene in front of us changed.
 
What appeared in front of me was not a welcoming crowd or the busy streets of a planetary city. I felt like I was in a hangar with many racks inside. I saw many flying saucers of different sizes on the racks. Several robots walked towards one of the flying saucers and worked around this one, probably the one we just rode in. I guessed that it must be the UFO warehouse.
 
I'm now looking at the exterior of the flying saucer we just rode in up close, and it's obviously a metal shell, lead-gray, no welds on the surface, no windows, holes, or anything like that, and there were no protruding lights visible, so how is it able to shoot light outward? I wondered.
 
When the saucer reached the Earth, it could hover over it, did the personnel enter and exit from the bottom? Inside the saucer was a very thick pillar, the middle of which was empty and connected to the door below.
 
At this point, the numbness in my brain disappeared, clear as day, and people got up in spirit.
 
I looked up and studied the UFO warehouse carefully. It was huge and could not be seen at a glance. And it was very high, several dozen stories tall. There were many layers of flying saucers hanging on the shelves, all of different sizes.
 
I stood on the ground and thought, "Such a big warehouse with so much space, what kind of material are their walls and roofs made of?
 
Because these houses were so massive, I assumed these materials wouldn't be available on Earth. It stretched for tens of kilometers without a single pillar in the middle, and it felt incredible.
 
In addition, I stood on the ground and felt that my body was much heavier than on Earth, and I felt a little overwhelmed. I think the gravitational force of this planet must be stronger than our Earth, which requires the roof material strength to be stronger.
 
I looked at the roof and thought to myself, what special material did they use to make the warehouse with such a large span?
 
The roof of the warehouse was too high for me to see clearly. I walked up to the warehouse walls, looked up carefully, and found that the warehouse walls were a soft, delicate yellow color, very fine, and without any flaws.
 
I felt puzzled, a wall, is it necessary to make it so exquisite? I looked closer and found that the wall was like the body of a robot on a spaceship, a combination of countless small delicate things, swaying slightly. This swaying is not the overall regular swaying, giving a sense of unease.
 
I used my hand to touch the wall again and found it empty. My hand seemed to be blocked by an invisible force, and the further my hand reached in, the greater the resistance, which was like two positive-to-polar magnets touching each other and repelling each other. However, I feel that this repulsive force is very strong. The general suction iron however, is not so strong.
 
"This wall is made of void matter, right?" I asked in my mind.
 
"Yes! This is a kind of void construction generated by the artificial field. It comes from those tiny black things under this wall. These black things are called artificial field generators, and they emit two kinds of fields. One is a repulsive field, symmetrical on a plane, the opposite of the gravitational field you have on Earth. With one plane as the center, it pushes everything outward.
 
"The middle part of the plane is called the light-curing field, which cures the light of the outside world within a particular spatial area. You see the yellow light, and this is the light-curing field just choose to cure the yellow and give up other colors.
 
"We can also choose to cure blue, red, green, and other colors, just according to the designer's preference.
 
"The light is collected from the surroundings, if it's at night, the amount of light collected will be less, and you'll see darker walls."
 
The mysterious standard male voice reappeared in my head and continued to say.
"You're smart to recognize that walls and roofs are virtual and are just a form of energy presence. If you press the switch in the artificial field, both the walls and the roof will immediately disappear cleanly.
 
"If accidentally hit by an object, these virtual walls and roofs can also withstand the impact with much higher strength than natural walls and roofs. However, there is still a limit.
 
"The object can still crash in and cause damage to the objects inside the virtual house if the speed and force of the impact exceed a certain limit, which is also dependent on the strength of our design. Obviously, the intensity level is proportional to the amount of energy.
 
"You may be surprised by this, but our planet is highly virtualized."
 
I did not anticipate that the first incredible thing I would encounter when I set foot on this planet would be a virtual wall.
