## Chapter 7
### First Look Teleportation and GPMN

We went directly to Norton's residence. Unlike on our planet, we were first outside the residence door and then entered through it.

Norton's home was elegant and beautiful and also had virtual walls, virtual bed, virtual couch, and something like a table, which was a physical object at first glance.

We sat on the virtual couch and felt very comfortable like an invisible force was supporting myself.

I ran to the bed, sat down, and felt very comfortable. "If you turn off the switch of this virtual bed, what is the result?"

"Pop, you just fall on the floor. That's the result," Santos said and suddenly pressed the switch, and I really fell on my butt on the floor. Although the height was not high because I was naked, I felt some pain. However, I tried to pretend that I didn't care.

"Unfriendly behavior!" Willow and Norton expressed their condemnation.

Santos pressed the switch again, the virtual bed was formed again, and I was forced out by an invisible force. But I didn't dare sit on the virtual bed again and ran to the virtual couch and sat down.

"Are you tired from this journey?" Willow sat beside me, suddenly concerned about me.

"The journey was not tiring, but when I reached your planet, I felt heavier, and it was a bit hard to walk barefoot," I replied while turning my body around, not daring to face Willow. Because I had no clothes on, although I saw that the white aerosol vapor around my waist was still there; but, out of instinct, I still felt embarrassed.

Later, on their planet, whenever I suddenly faced a woman, I would involuntarily panic to see if the white aerosol void around my waist existed because of the feeling of nake.

I found that the Goks are also naked, and their clothes are virtual; however, they have long been used to it and have absolutely no habit of me panicking to look at my lower body when I see the opposite sex.

I still had this habit of panicking and looking at my lower body as soon as I saw a young woman after I returned from an alien planet, and it lasted for years before it slowly changed.

"Our planet has a stronger gravitational pull than your Earth, so you feel a little heavier than on Earth. That can make you feel uncomfortable from time to time," Norton said.

"I've to ask the Global Public Motion Network to reduce your weight."

"What, the Global Public Motion Network?" I said incredulously. "Why would the Global Public Exercise Network be able to reduce a person's weight? How can you lose a person's weight from the outside without separating something from their body? What is the Global Public Motion Network?"

"We are using the Global Public Motion Network to instantly transport us from a flying saucer warehouse more than 10,000 kilometers away to our home."After Norton finished speaking, he wiped his hands on a table, and a delicate white smoke immediately appeared on top of the table. A few moments later, the white smoke turned into a three-dimensional picture again, the same as the three-dimensional picture I saw in the flying saucer. Many alien words appeared on the screen. I found that these alien words were somewhat like English, as if they were a combination of some basic letters, unlike our Chinese hieroglyphic characters.

Norton manipulated elegantly with his hands, and a soft female voice appeared in my ears. "Welcome to the Global Public Motion ..."

Norton messed around for a while, and I suddenly felt my body lighter and felt much more relaxed. Ah, it's so strange. What did Norton do? The global public motion network exactly what is it?

Norton explained to me,
"The main equipment of the Global Public Motion Network is the artificial field generator on our planet. Like your synchronous satellites on Earth, this generator rotates around our planet in synchronization. However, the artificial field generator is larger than your Earth's satellites.

"Our planet has 9 of them, and the influence covers the whole planet. These devices can launch a special, artificially created - artificial field - anywhere globally. This actually affects physical space and thus the objects that exist in space. Artificial field generators plus GPS, computers, and global public information networks make up the Global Public Motion Network.

"When we are out on a trip and want help from the global public motion network, the approximate process goes like this: we first pass our motion request information to the artificial field generator in space via the public information network.

"The artificial field generator first confirms your identity, after which it locks your position via GPS and then irradiates your location and the area where you want to appear. This allows you to disappear at your location and appear at once where you want to go. Because this process is too fast for people to feel, we generally refer to this process of motion as instantaneous motion, also called transience."

"I can't imagine that the global public motion network is invisible and untouchable, but it also looks mighty," I said.

"It's very powerful, more powerful than flying saucer, and it's easy to use. Passengers don't need to bring anything with them. Then why don't you use the global public network to go to other planets?"

"The reason the GPMN can only work on one planet is that the artificial field generator only shines on our planet and has a limited range of action. We can only travel from one planet to another with a flying saucer," Norton replied.

"It seems that the core of this global public motion network is the artificial field generator, and everything else is auxiliary. So what is the basic principle of this artificial field generator?" I asked.

"The basic principle is the same as flying saucer. The artificial field generator irradiates the person, causing the space around the person to disappear at the speed of light motion. The space around the person would have been moving at the speed of light, which is how people and objects create mass. After the person's mass becomes zero, it will move at the speed of light, move to the end of the target, and then make the space around the person move back to its original state.

"If something is blocked in the middle, the mass of the blocked object becomes zero in the same way so that it can pass through the blocked object without resistance or obstruction.

"However, the mass going to zero here is a relative concept. That is, I think the mass goes to zero while you may think the mass does not change".

Norton's explanation left me a little confused and a little incredulous.

"That means that two solids that are hard and irradiated by an artificial field generator can both pass through each other without any obstacle, right?" I asked, "Why wouldn't the molecules in the solids block each other anymore?"

Norton replied, "Ordinary objects are made of atoms, which are composed of a nucleus and electrons outside the nucleus, and the volume of the electrons and nucleus is only a few tens of billions of parts of the volume of the atom. Under normal circumstances, a person walking in front of a wall is blocked by the wall; the reason is that the molecules and atoms in the wall are using interaction forces to form a whole; these interaction forces are essentially electromagnetic forces.

"We are actually blocked by these electromagnetic forces. If there were no such electromagnetic forces, we can easily pass through the human body.

"The artificial field device makes the electromagnetic forces disappear in the object so that two solids can easily pass through each other. However, the disappearance of these electromagnetic field forces is a relative concept, i.e., they disappear in one person's view while they remain in another."

Norton's explanation made me a little dizzy.

"The artificial field generator can reduce the mass of the object. I now feel lighter due to this artificial field generator from time to time tracking irradiation me. so that my body mass reduced, and can not completely make my body mass to zero, only part of the reduction, is that right?" I asked Norton.

Norton said, "Yes, you are very clever, that's right."

"There must be a reason why the floaters (referring to the particularly advanced alien civilization I encountered as a child) found him," Willow interjected.

"Chienko definitely belongs to the smart people on Earth. I should say that Earthlings are also considered intelligent biological people. It's just that, on Earth, they like to fight and kill each other and use all their intelligence for that," Santos said.

"Earthlings also have the vice of dividing people into many classes, considering certain people as superior and emphasizing certain people as inferior pariahs."

"Is Chienko an upper-class person on Earth or an inferior one?" Willow asked, staring at me.

"I am the lowest of the low and the noblest of the high. I'm just interested in the GPMN right now," I said to Norton. "Is this GPMN a panacea?"

"This artificial field device that can make people disappear instantly is not foolproof, and it has many limitations.

"If the device's energy does not reach a certain value, the resulting human work field cannot produce instantaneous disappearing motion when irradiating a person. If the mass of the object making the instantaneous disappearing motion is too large, or if the masses of many objects add up to too much, then the device's energy will not work. Also, if the device is unstable while working, a person could get stuck and die while going through the wall," Norton went on to explain to me.

"The device of the artificial field to make an object as big as a planet to do the action of instantly disappearing is much more difficult than transporting a person. The amount of energy consumed is correspondingly large. It's easy to get a person through a wall, to get a person through a planet. The power requirements of the artificial field equipment are particularly huge and consume a staggering amount of capacity. Otherwise, the result would be to get the person stuck in the planet and kill them. In fact, we don't have such high-powered artificial field equipment."

I still have a lot of questions about the GPMN.

"What if a tiny room suddenly has a lot of people demanding access?" I asked.

"Not only is the GPMN highly intelligent, but it is also tied to the Global Information Network," Santos offered an explanation.

"The Public Motion Network will alert you: the space you requested to reach is full, your request for this transmission is not supported by the Public Motion Network, and you can choose next time or delay," Willow's words were similar to those of Karen, the information network customer service that often appeared in my ears.

"I want to make myself appear at night in a bank vault with a large sum of money in my bag. Appear at night in the beautiful woman's room ah, let her and me ..., in which case, won't society be in chaos?" I said.

"Haha," Santos laughed out loud, his body trembling with the rhythm of laughter.

"That's all you earthlings have!

"This global public action network is highly intelligent. When you request to let yourself appear in the bank warehouse and in the beautiful woman room on the global public motion network. The virtual screen of the global public motion network pops up, 'Sorry, your request violates the relevant laws, and this motion network does not support it.'

"When you request to appear in the dangerous ocean of the Global Public Motion Network, the Global Public Motion Network pops up on the screen,
'The Global Public Motion Network warmly reminds you that the ocean is a dangerous area, so please be careful to bring your Internet access device with you so that you can return safely.

Global Public Motion Network will pop up on your screen if you do not have a computer or cell phone with Internet access.

Sorry, the Global Public Motion Network has detected that you do not have a computer or other Internet access device with you and cannot guarantee your safe return.'

"When you ask the Global Public Motion Network to send you somewhere, and you click randomly on your computer, the place you click is 10 meters above the ground. The Global Public Motion Network immediately prompts you,

'The motion network will follow your instructions and complete this motion request. The default is to send you to the ground ten meters vertically below your specified location for your safety.'

"When you request to make yourself available on another planet on the Global Public Motion Network, then will pop up on the screen,
'Sorry, the Global Public Motion Network can only move people and objects around the globe. Your request is beyond our capabilities.'

"When you see a gorgeous mountain, and you ask the GPMN on your computer to move it to your home, the GPMN pops up on the screen and says,
'Sorry, the Global Public Motion Network can only move people and things under 100 tons worldwide for ordinary users like you, and your request is beyond your rights.'

"When you see something that belongs to someone else, and you ask the Global Public Motion Network on your computer to move it to your residence, the GPMN pops up on the screen and says,
'This is someone else's property, and your request violates the relevant laws and is not supported by this motion network. "

Santos said a lot in one breath, and many of my questions were explained.

"I was mentally amazed at this public motion network. I thought how nice it would be if such a thing existed on Earth. I wanted to go to America, find the address in America through the information network, and as soon as I pressed the OK button, I appeared in that place in America. If I want to come back, I can find the address of my hometown again, and as soon as I press the OK button, I come back immediately. How amazing and convenient this is! " I said.

"Oh, I see, you have no cars on the street, no trains, no planes, no transportation of any kind, people go out without luggage, they don't put a lot of items at home, just because of the global public motion network; because it is so convenient to go out and transfer items," I said.

"There were no stores either. You could buy things and send them directly from the manufacturer's warehouse. There are also no hotels or motels because you can get home quickly, no matter how far away."

"Oh, yes, we are such a society," Santos said.

"The fantastic GPMN that makes everything easy, fast, safe, and efficient! " I exclaimed, "Can I ask the GPMN to let me run a race?"

"You can't, you don't have an identity, but if you run as one of us as attachments," Norton said.

"For example, you as my appendage, like my luggage with me at all times. I ask for a global public moviton network that can take you away. You are from an alien planet and have no identity, so you cannot use the Global Public Motion Network.

"Later you will know that there are many other important uses for the Global Public Motion Network. If you have a global public motion network on your planet, it will significantly impact your life, studies, work, and research activities. It will make a major change in the pattern of your city because people don't need to be crammed together.

"It will even make countries and wars on your planet disappear, for the warring parties, because they can be forcibly separated by the global public motion network.

"It is on the GPMN that we on Planet Gok depend to eat and get energy for our bodies, basically.

"The GPMN can also change the moral and legal concepts of society. Where society doesn't need human morals and laws because a person wants to do something bad, and the Global Public Motion Network can stop it at any time so that you can't succeed in doing something bad. "

"Oh, by the way, if the Global Public Motion Network suddenly stopped, you would all lose your lives, wouldn't you?" I exclaimed.

"Yes!" Santos and Norton replied in unison.

"Our two major networks are constantly locating and tracking every person on the planet on a global scale, constantly providing them with various services. This service may only stop when that person leaves their planet," Santos said.

"You earthlings are also building the Internet now, and eventually, the Internet will develop similarly to our global public information network. Only you still don't have a global public motion network on Earth.

"Our global public information network can provide various information services for everyone, such as communication with the outside world, inquiry, location, greeting, translation, confirmation, and authentication of various identities of people. Our information network can transmit information through pure space, and we provide information services by using artificial field scanning in a remote and non-contact way, and all of this is free of charge.

"Our artificial field scanning technology can read each person's brain consciousness remotely and input information to each person's brain remotely through space. artificial field scanning technology can access and send information directly through space, which means that people can communicate directly over long distances through global information networks. This is our artificial field scanning frequency intercept technology."

"So why are you using external computers again?" I asked, puzzled.

"Sometimes too much information goes directly to the human brain, which can interfere with the human brain and give people a very annoying feeling. Many times our people also use various computer devices outside," Norton explained to me.

"The global information network that keeps track of us and the global public motion network is very powerful, so each of us can be powerful wherever we go. Because these two networks are always tracking us and providing us with all kinds of services. We are not in danger wherever we are, and these two networks can provide us with all kinds of reliable security," Santos said.

"If something comes up that poses a real threat to our people, our global public motion network is highly intelligent and can quickly move people to a safe place. Our GPIN not only provides a wide range of information services at all times, but it can also record information about a person's thoughts and consciousness at any time from a distance and without contact.

"Once the person has an accident and loses his life, the global information network can record the person's mind and consciousness intact. It can install the information of the person's mind and consciousness into the brain of a person artificially created by us through artificial field scanning technology to bring the person back to life. "

Later I learned that the Global Information Network of Planet Gok provided them with information services, and the Global Public Motion Network provided them with services in various aspects such as transportation, processing and manufacturing, and daily activities, which significantly broadened their capabilities.
