### Talking About Flying Saucers in Flight
 
Whenever my body felt relaxed, I could always hear a soft, sweet, clingy female voice somewhere in my ears, talking over and over again. I see a planet appear on the stereoscopic virtual screen, and then it disappears quickly.
 
They started up the ship and then left it alone, letting the robot watching the stereoscopic virtual screen operate the ship, and then we started talking.
 
I was curious about the ship, and I became interested in the flying saucer we were riding in.
 
"This ship we're on is what we Earthlings always call a flying saucer, right?"
 
"Yes."
 
"Flying saucers fly very fast, don't they? I read in one of our magazines that the fastest flying saucer can travel at the speed of light, which is 300,000 kilometers per second, is that right?"
 
"Yes, the fastest flying saucers are moving at the speed of light," said Santos.
 
"There are three space-time states of flying saucers. One is the zero-mass excited state, in which the saucer has zero rest mass, a definite moving mass, and is always moving at the speed of light.
This state is practically the same as the spatiotemporal state of light emitted in nature.
 
"The second is the quasi-excited state of tiny masses. Take the example of this flying saucer, which has a mass of only about one ten-thousandth of a gram by your earthly standards. It can be stationary, can travel at any speed below the speed of light, can hover in the air on Earth's surface, or can be excited to an excited state of zero mass at any time. 
 
"Third, it has the same definite mass as a usual object in its usual state with its mass-varying power system off."
 
"Your flying saucer is so powerful. What is the principle of its flight? It must be very complicated and profound, right?"
 
"The flying principle of the flying saucer is actually very simple, and can be described in just one sentence in your Chinese language," Santos said.
 
"Any object in the universe, if you make its mass become zero, it will suddenly move at the speed of light at the moment it becomes zero; this is the principle of flight for a light-speed flying saucer."
 
Is the flying principle of flying saucers so simple? I was not thinking about it. But how can we make the mass of an object become zero? I believe this is a real question. 
 
"There are two very different kinds of motion in nature, one quantitative and one qualitative. Ordinary motion is quantitative, and your earthly scientists Newton and Galileo described these motions very well.
 
"As mastered by you earthlings, the principle of motion of airplanes and cars is that momentum is mass multiplied by velocity, and force is the degree to which momentum changes with time. Your planes can only fly within the Earth's atmosphere.
 
"The momentum of our flying saucer is the vector velocity of light minus the speed of motion of the saucer, multiplied by the mass of the saucer, and the force of the saucer is also the degree to which the momentum of the saucer changes with time, but the saucer only changes mass with time.
 
"The change in velocity is sudden. It can suddenly accelerate from zero to the speed of light. There is only an initial velocity and the light-speed, and the change in rate is discontinuous," Norton explained.
 
"The principle of motion for our flying saucer is another kind of motion - mass change, that is, the mass of the saucer can change with time. When the mass of this saucer goes from a certain amount to zero, the saucer does not need additional force to accelerate; it must maintain its inertial motion at the speed of light unless it encounters an internal or external cause to change this motion.
 
"The space around any object at rest relative to us in the universe, is moving in all directions at the speed of light, and this is the fundamental cause of the mass of an object. It represents the number of bars of space displacement around the object moving at the speed of light.
 
"If you find a way to make the motion of the space around the object at the speed of light disappear, then the object has no mass, and an object with zero mass does not need to apply another force; it must be moving at the speed of light relative to us."
 
I seemed to understand what was going on and asked,
"So, then your flying saucer can fly at the speed of light, I read in our books on Earth, in cosmic space, the average planet is many light-years away from us, if your flying saucer is to fly at the speed of light then it also surely takes many years? How come it takes only a few hours to fly to your planet? Are you so close to us that you are actually hiding from sight?"
 
"When an object is moving at the speed of light, the length of space it is within shortens to zero along the direction of motion," Norton's words surprised me a little.
 
Santos added, "That's what you people on Earth call, far away and close." 
 
"The length of space along the direction of motion is zero, so wouldn't your flying saucers take no time when they are traveling at the speed of light? Then why do you say that the saucer takes several hours to fly back to your planet?" I asked.
 
"For example, consider a flying saucer with a mass of 450 tons (I forget the exact number), if the saucer takes off from 450 tons to zero, the process takes time, which is called switching space-time states. When the saucer lands, it changes from zero to 450 tons, which also takes time.
 
"In fact, when the UFO is on our planet, first, the mass of the UFO is reduced to a tiny amount, such as 0.450 grams, by using external electrical energy or field energy to reach a quasi-excited state. Once the mass of the saucer reaches zero, it will be in an excited state and will suddenly move at the speed of light without applying additional force.
 
"When the flying saucer reaches your planet, its mass will not become 450 tons, but instead just a tiny amount. Why? To save energy. The flying saucer itself cannot carry much energy, because it takes a lot of energy to change the mass of the saucer and to transform the space-time state.
 
"The energy equation for the flying saucer is the mass of the flying saucer multiplied by the square of the speed of light. And from this equation, it takes a massive amount of energy to change the mass of the saucer," Norton explained.
 
He then went on to add, "When there is thin gas in front of the ship, we can use the field generated by the flying saucer to make these gasses transform the space-time state so that the mass of the gas also becomes zero and does not interact with our ship. The collision of two objects with zero mass will not occur as a force.
 
"However, if we encounter a planet, we have no way to zero the mass of the entire planet and no way to make the entire planet shift its space-time state because the energy required is particularly huge.
 
"Then we can only avoid this planet. When avoiding this planet, the saucer has to change its state. If our saucer is flying without a planet in the way, it can keep flying.
 
"When our saucer takes off, its mass becomes zero, and this process takes time. When we reach the planet, the mass of the saucer will change from zero to a tiny amount when we land, which also takes time.
 
"The hours during the flight are mainly spent switching space-time states to avoid the planet."
 
Santos said, "According to your planet's theory of relativity, suppose our planet is 50 light-years away from your Earth, and a flying saucer leaves our planet, it flies to your planet at the speed of light, and then returns immediately; both the people of your planet and our people think the saucer will take 100 years to complete the round trip, and only the passengers inside the saucer think that it will just take a few hours."
 
"Is this true what you say? I mean, if it is true, then the people of your planet are also slowly waiting for you to return, and it's not easy for you to make a trip to Earth," I said.
 
"This is the actual situation, but also take into account the fast and slow passage of time between our planet and your planet, the universe is different on different planets depending on how fast and slow the passage of time is.
 
"Of course, we can artificially change the speed of the passage of time. When the flying saucer takes off, we scan it with an artificial field so that the space around the saucer is in an energy field that can artificially change the space-time around the saucer. The flying saucer leaves this special energy field quite differently than it leaves our planet. The result is that the people on our planet, instead of waiting 100 years, may only have to wait a few hours. The exact time depends on the strength of the energy field."
 
The word Santos, I simply could not understand.
 
"We Earthlings have also observed your flying saucers and found that they suddenly accelerate violently, and the passengers inside are subjected to great forces. Or is it that your people have special bodies that can resist forces hundreds or thousands of times greater than those of earthlings?" I asked.
 
"Flying saucers fly with zero or tiny mass, and the force on the passengers inside is the acceleration multiplied by the mass; with zero mass acceleration, even if it is huge, the force on the passengers is zero, or very tiny. Flying saucers have zero mass or close to zero, collision forces with other objects and friction forces are zero or extremely tiny, which is an explanation for the lack of sound when flying through the air of your planet," Physicist Santos explained to me.
 
I seemed to understand somewhat and continued to ask, "So what does it take to make a flying saucer? Or how is a flying saucer made?"
 
"You're going back to Earth to make a flying saucer?" Willow asked rhetorically, "You build a flying saucer so that you can ride around in it."
 
"Haha," Santos laughed out loud, "If Chienko got careless while piloting and ran to Mars near their Earth and didn't know how to come back, it would be big trouble."
 
"Then Chienko should simply live on Mars," Willow said somewhat mockingly. "If Chienko has a girlfriend on Earth, they'll be sad and miserable. Their movies often show such scenes, don't they?"
 
"I don't have a girlfriend, and I don't want to go to Mars!" I wanted to retort to their taunts but held my tongue instead.
 
Norton said, "With Chienko's power alone, how could he have built a flying saucer?
 
"If he mastered the principle of flying saucers, and the people of their planet believed in his theory, the earthlings would frantically put their power into developing flying saucers, just like the earthlings did when they developed the atomic bomb, and only then would it be possible for the earthlings to build flying saucers."
 
"So, how much does it cost to develop a flying saucer?" I asked.
 
"About the same as the cost of developing the atomic bomb on your planet," Norton replied.
 
"Not likely, when Chienko went back to tell his fellow Earthlings what a flying saucer was all about and what they should do to build one. Guess what? His fellow Earthlings would say, 'Ah! Where is this mental patient from? Crazy nonsense?’" Santos continued sarcastically.
 
I found Santos's words harsh, but this is the most likely scenario.
 
"Then you must be carrying a lot of energy in your flying saucer. What kind of energy are you using?"
 
"Nuclear energy and neutron energy. Don't forget that flying saucers are inertial in long-distance flight, and they don't need energy. They change their mass to zero at the beginning of take-off and need tremendous energy to transform the space-time state. When the saucer takes off on our planet, we first use external electrical energy or field energy to dramatically reduce the mass of the saucer to a tiny amount," Norton reminded me.
 
"Then why are your flying saucers made in the shape of a round saucer and in which direction are they flying? What is the approximate power system of the saucer like? Can you briefly tell me about all of these things?" I asked.
 
"The flying saucer is actually similar to your Particle Accelerator on Earth, the circular part of the edge of the saucer is a circular cavity, it is surrounded by a stream of charged particles.
 
"These charged particles have the same charge and repel each other, so the density cannot increase. By allowing these charged particles to move at high speed, the electric field can be converted into a magnetic field, and by doing so, the density of the charge can be increased.
 
"The doors of small flying saucers usually open at the bottom; if they opened at the side, they could disrupt the flow of charged particles around the saucer. Large flying saucers generally carry high-powered Artificial Field scanning equipment that scans the saucer shell so that the shell is in an excited state, so that personnel can enter and exit directly from the saucer shell, generally without leaving the door open.
 
"When the flying saucer is flying at light-speed, its direction of motion is perpendicular to the disc surface of the saucer and satisfies the right-hand spiral relationship. Imagine we hold the flying saucer with our right hand, and the four fingers surround the direction with the direction of the disc circumference edge line, that is, the internal charged particles surround the direction of motion, then the thumb direction is the direction of movement of the flying saucer.
 
"If the saucer arrives over your Earth, it is in a quasi-excited state and can fly at any speed below the speed of light, or it can be piloted manually, and its direction of flight can be in either direction along the side of the saucer."
 
"So, when the saucer arrives over our Earth, is it then fitted with an ordinary engine that stirs the air and flies like a plane on Earth would?" I asked.
 
"No, what we do is make the transition from the quasi-excited state to the excited state so that the saucer moves up at the speed of light. But the set flight time was extreme, so the saucer flew a very tiny distance, then returned to the quasi-excited state, then transitioned from the quasi-excited state to the excited state, then it flew a small distance, and the saucer just kept switching flight states over and over again to fly. This type of flight is also controlled by a computer program, i.e., assisted piloting.
 
"Flying over your Earth in this way, from the outside, the saucer can fly at any speed, and also exhibits no inertia, it can turn at right angles, has extremely high maneuverability, and has incredible flight trajectory. To you earthlings, this looks strange," Santos corrected me.
 
"How much power does a flying saucer have? How do you make the saucer move at the speed of light, or how do you make the saucer have zero mass?" I was still scratching my head over this question.
 
Santos provided me with an answer, "The basic principle of the flying saucer power system is the interconversion of electromagnetic and gravitational fields, where both uniform linear motion and accelerated motion of charges can produce a gravitational field.
 
"We observe two primary principles.
 
"One is that the uniform linear motion of the charge produces a positive and negative gravitational field distributed along the surface in opposite directions of motion.
 
"The other is that the magnetic field generated by accelerated charge is variable and the variation of the magnetic field distributed over the surface can produce a linear gravitational field and a linear electric field distributed along the edge line of the surface, where at a given instant, the varying magnetic field and the resulting electric and gravitational fields are perpendicular to each other.
 
"The gravitational field generated by moving charges is continuously distributed, while the gravitational field generated by gravity is symmetrically distributed with a point center. How to turn the continuously distributed gravitational field into a point symmetrical gravitational field is the key."
 
Then Norton told me.
"Your Earth scientist Faraday’s theory of: electricity to magnetism and magnetism to electricity, using the interconversion of electricity and magnetism, made electricity available on a large scale on your Earth, which had a profound effect on your Earth people.
 
"Faraday said that the changing magnetic field produces an electric field in a perpendicular direction, and actually produces a gravitational field in another perpendicular direction, and the changing magnetic field, electric field, and gravitational field are perpendicular to each other.
 
"The flying principle of our saucers is to use the interconversion of electromagnetic and gravitational fields. The changing electromagnetic fields can produce positive and anti-gravitational fields. In particular, the anti-gravitational field irradiates onto the object and can reduce the mass of the object to even zero. As soon as the mass of the object becomes zero, it will then suddenly move at the speed of light in an excited state. This is the reason why flying saucers can travel at the speed of light.
 
"Your Earth uses electricity on a large scale, while our Earth does not use electricity and uses Artificial Field Scanning. The positive and negative gravitational fields generated by changing electromagnetic fields, working under computer control, are called Artificial Field Scanning.
 
"If you earthlings master the mystery of the interconversion of electromagnetic and gravitational fields, you can create light-speed flying saucers and develop artificial field scanning technology.
 
"Artificial field scanning is not just about ensuring objects have zero mass, moving at the speed of light, and creating light-speed flying saucers. There are many other incredible applications. Examples include:
Large-scale cold welding in construction and industrial manufacturing.
Computer-controlled human healing.
Technology for instantaneous movement.
The creation of global movement networks.
The ability to produce cheap, clean energy by making converging solar receivers.
 
"Artificial field scanning can also create many products that alter time and space. It can create virtual buildings and virtual bodies of light. It can also process information, and it can read and store human consciousness, it can even enable long-distance human-to-human communication directly through the human brain ..."
 
Despite Norton and the others giving me the above explanation, I still had a hard time understanding it, and I still had many flying saucer questions.
 
"So do you guys often fly such flying saucers to explore other planets?"
 
"Yes, we have been to your planet many times," Norton confirmed my suspicions." You are also the subject of our long-term expedition."
