### Land-Based and Water-Based Human Species in the Universe

"Besides us Earthlings and you Gok people, are there many other human planets in the universe?" I asked.

"That's for sure. We have found many, more of different kinds of people," Norton replied. "Although there are many kinds of people in the universe, most of them have evolved from lower creatures. From the point of view of evolution, they can be divided into two kinds: one kind evolved from the low-level creatures on land, called the land-based human species.

"You earthlings, we Gokians, are evolved from the land, a land-based evolved human race. Although the early origin of life on your planet was in the water, most of your Earthling evolution was done on land and should belong to the land-based human race. The land-based human species is the majority in the universe.

"Some animals, such as the birds you mentioned on Earth, which can fly in the air, actually belong to the land-based species because birds also started their evolution on land. Most of the evolutionary process was done on the ground.

"If they evolved from lower-level creatures in the water, they are called water-based species. What we Goks really like is the water-based human species, and we have many Goks who like or covet the bodies of the water-based evolved human species. "

"What about our Earthling bodies, are they considered excellent among the many, many species?" I wanted to know what they thought of our Earthling bodies.

"It's terrible," Willow interjected.

"It's garbage," Santos interjected as well."Your Earthling bodies are poorly evolved."

"Why do you Goks look so much like us Earthlings?" I asked.

"Because we both belong to a land-based evolved species," Norton said.

"Land-based evolved creatures that started walking on the ground. Walking on four legs on the ground is the most stable, and combined with having a head to detect paths and direct actions, this pattern is the most superior pattern for land animals in the universe.

"The reason why land animals have this mode is the result of long-term natural evolution. There are advantages and disadvantages. They would have been eliminated long ago if they walked on three legs due to instability.

"Later, the hands and feet were separated, and man could walk upright for the simple reason of making tools and using them. For this reason, along the terrestrial evolution of the universe, all people evolved to the final stage, with almost the same external shape.

"That is to say, different animals evolved to the end, and all tended to have the same shape as we now have as humans. The Gok people and your earthlings are similar in physical shape for this reason. In a word, it's all about natural selection and survival of the fittest.

"Later, we could make our own bodies artificially, so why not cause strange shapes? This is not exactly caused by traditional habits but mainly by aesthetic decisions. It is that people think the previous body is beautiful and sexy. If you create strange shapes, there will be no beauty. We now also developed and manufactured some strange human species, but still around sexy, beautiful, did not get away from this mainline."

Norton waved his hand and immediately appeared a three-dimensional image, on which a variety of people appeared, but all on all fours plus a head, walking upright. Norton continued.

"Compared with evolved animals on land, evolved animals in the water, for a long time, can not make and use their own tools and products, so their evolutionary process is very long, some never evolved into advanced intelligent humans.

"Especially some planets completely covered by water, if there is not a developed exoplanet people to take them away, in the water evolved billions of years of water creatures, although very intelligent, perfect physical function, there are many but still stuck in the stage of can not make and use products and tools. However, these water-based evolutions of animals, in the billions of years of evolution, the advantages of the body are obvious. The body of a variety of excellent performances is breathtaking.

"Look at your human beings on Earth; although intelligent, but skin, muscles, bones are poor in all aspects, suffering from chronic diseases are many. Among people over 50 years old, the number of people suffering from chronic diseases is almost 100 percent, and some people suffer from chronic diseases for a long time, and you have no way to solve them.

"Therefore, the land evolution of human beings, although they can manufacture and use tools products, their own body evolution is not superior enough, while the water evolution of animals, the body structure is extremely optimized, many characteristics are extremely superior, is the land evolution of animals can not be reached.

"In the universe, there are many planets where intelligent animals evolved by water-based evolution can manufacture tools and products, have scientific knowledge and other intelligent civilizations, and finally control and dominate entire planets and galaxies.

"So, how did water-based evolved animals do this?

"It turns out that water-based evolved animals were able to split their own bodies and mastered powerful parasitic skills during billions of years of evolution by parasitizing in other organisms to control other organisms, especially to control and transform land-based animals to achieve the purpose of manufacturing tools and products.

"It is important to be able to split their own body. Water-based animals divide their bodies into small parts but still maintain their body traits and various information. By splitting their bodies into smaller parts, they can better parasitize other organisms with larger bodies.

"Aquatic organisms can grow very large because they live in water, and with the buoyancy of the water, their bodies can grow very large. The same species can have very different bodies. Only a huge body can allow a person with a small body to parasitize him.

"Of course, their parasitic methods are very advanced, unlike your Earth's parasitic methods that simply gnaw on the host's flesh as food. Most of their parasites contain sexual elements, which can not only provide sexual bribes to each other and give each other extreme pleasure but also improve various functions of each other's bodies and can co-exist with each other for a long time.

"In our Gok galaxy, there live many water-based intelligent animals that evolved in the sea. They are almost all varieties that we have imported from other planets in the universe, although very advanced and powerful, even to the point of terror. But they weren't lucky enough to have land creatures more powerful than them overshadow them. They did not become the masters of our galaxy. They are still in the process of evolution and may become the masters of our galaxy in the future.

"These large underwater intelligent animals that want to parasitize smaller land creatures in their own bodies usually swallow you right down in one bite. Then all kinds of flesh tubes grow savagely in your body, providing you with nourishment, but controlling you. In this way, you can be submissively parasitic in their bodies.

"Some large intelligent creatures, after sucking you into their bodies, generally do not easily let you out, and some, even if they let you out, will leave parts of their bodies inside you and continue to parasitize you. In short, once you are sucked into their bodies, it is very difficult to get rid of them completely.

"The small intelligent creatures underwater are usually sneaky and seductive, first approaching you with something very small, and once burrowed into your body, they will control you. You want to break free is almost impossible. You basically can not escape their clutches by their lifelong parasitic in your body.

"Some are very cunning and separate very small parts of their bodies and use very small things to invade your body when you are not paying attention. The small things that invade inside your body are connected to the outside with thin wires, and you try to get rid of them with violence, dragging your body inside with severe pain, and then the second step, the body is all inside your body again.

"Some parasitic species are like gelatinous substances, some disguised as liquid, slowly seeping into your body to control you.

"Some parasites in our Gok galaxy were achieved using our advanced technology. We can create and modify human bodies to give them the ability to parasitize other creatures or to suck other creatures into their bodies and have other creatures parasitize them.

"Parasitic humans on many planets in the universe evolved naturally. We have parasite forums in the Gok system to exchange knowledge and skills about parasites and to provide technical, material, and other assistance to parasites.

"Our parasites appear to be scattered in different parts of the GoK galaxy but can actually exchange information and are well organized.

"Some of us have two identities; we can have a normal human identity and a parasite identity. With the help of a global public movement network and a global information network, human senses and memories can be readily interchanged. "
