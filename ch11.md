### Reasons for the Strange Sexual Behavior of Gok Aliens

Norton also gave me some reasons for the strange sexual behavior of the Gok aliens.

"On your planet, the meaning of sex is one, to reproduce and maintain a family; and two, to bring pleasure to yourself and your sexual partner. In order to maintain a family between a man and a woman and to raise the next generation, all these need material wealth as a basis. Therefore, the relationship between men and women on your planet is not only that of sexual partners but also that of partnership.

"A man giving his possessions to a woman or a woman giving her possessions to a man can bring pleasure to each other, and a man and a woman can maintain their relationship with each other only with material wealth.

"Sexuality on your planet is governed by various factors, such as morals and laws, culture, and traditional practices.

"On your planet, there is not only sex between a man and a woman but also love, affection, care, etc.

"The meaning of our sex is only for pleasure, experience, feeling, and there is only naked sex between men and women, no love.

"Material resources are not important to us. We have no next generation, no death, life and health are absolutely guaranteed. So we do not need to partner to make money and start a family. We are no parents, no need to take care of the next generation, no need to care for our own and each other's physical health.

"We have no moral or legal constraints, and sexual behavior is often accompanied by violence. This is why we have popularized remote virtual sex activities. Because of remote virtual sex, a person can terminate sex at any time and avoid being violently harmed by the other person.

"You are living on Earth in the sense of wealth and power. We are living in the sense of various feelings experiences. Of all the various human experiences, the one that gives the most pleasure is undoubtedly the sexual experience. Our people are therefore particularly keen on this sexual experience.

"In a sense, there is really no difference between Earthlings having sex with us Goks and having sex with animals because Goks have no love, only sex, no feelings, only experiences.

"In our Gok system, sex between humans and animals, that is, between species, is very common, which may seem like a horrible thing to you."

Norton's last statement reminded me of what Santos had said about men on our planet having sex with sows and cows, and a twinge of unease appeared in my mind.

Norton spoke again of sex between parasites.

"We also have a great prevalence of parasitic people on the planet Gok. Sexual acts between parasites and hosts are also barbaric. The parasites on your planet gnaw on the bodies of their hosts for food. And on our Gok planet, material resources and food is indifferent to whatever everyone. The reason is that technology is advanced and material resources are easily sourced, which is much more civilized than your planet. Unlike your earthlings, who still compete with each other for material resources, food, energy, this competition may lead to killing each other's bodies.

"However, the people of our planet Gok also continue the genes of the animals who have been fighting each other for billions of years, but the struggle has changed from fighting for material wealth to using parasitism to fight for and control the bodies of the opposite sex.

"For parasites, the struggle is equally brutal. It is primarily about plundering and controlling each other's bodies as their own sex slaves, not about destroying each other's bodies.

"Our technology has driven the parasites to become stronger and more perverted in all sorts of strange behaviors. Unlike you earthlings, parasites on the planet Gok do not revere love or fall in love. Sex becomes predatory and aggressive, and sexual behavior becomes violent, cruel, bizarre, and perverted, at least in the eyes of your Earthlings."
