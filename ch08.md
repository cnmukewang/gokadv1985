## Chapter 8
### Interesting Gok’s People

I was sitting on the virtual couch in Norton's place, and I was gradually feeling hungry. "Hey, I feel a little hungry. What do you guys usually eat?"

Norton said, "We forgot about you. You earthlings eat differently than we do. "

"Then how do you usually eat?"

"The energy our bodies need also comes from the chemical energy of food. We have the Global Public Motion Network, and when we need food energy, we can ask the GPMN to instantaneously transfer food directly into our bodies. It's usually liquid and almost completely usable by our bodies," Norton replied.

"The liquid is in a bottle, and as the bottle gets to your stomach? How do you digest the contents of the bottle?"

"It goes in transfer without a bottle,"said Santos. "We don't have a stomach, or intestines, liver, kidneys, bladder, or anything like that. The inside of our body, starting with our mouth and ending with the lower half of our body, is just a cavity. Our food is highly processed, and the body can use it directly.

"Many of our body's functions, breathing, digestion, and excretion are outsourced to the circulatory system outside. It makes our bodies structurally simple, and the simpler the body, the more superior the function and the less likely we are to get sick. Only species with primitive and backward bodies like yours on Earth have stomachs, intestines, liver, kidneys, bladder ... etc. It is really both complicated and troublesome.

"In fact, when our body lacks energy, the Global Public Motion Network will instantly transfer food energy to our body. Everything is done automatically under computer control without our bother.

"Now, I request the Global Public Motion Network to deliver food to you," Norton said, raised his left hand and jerked the air in his ears; a delicate bottle and metal scissors suddenly appeared on the table in Norton's house. The bottle was shaped somewhat like a penguin, silvery-white, and made of metal. The top of the bottle had a protruding part that stuck out long like a penguin's beak.

Norton cut the elongated part of the bottle with scissors and handed the bottle to me. I took the bottle and drank it. The liquid had a floral aroma, a pleasant fragrance. I drank it and felt a sweetness that tasted good.

Norton waved his hand over his ear again, and this bottle, the bottle cut off that little piece, and the scissors all suddenly disappeared. I think it must be the global public motion network transmitted them back.

"Why do you wave your hand at your ear and ask the Global Public Motion Network to teleport something? Do you have a switch by your ear?"

"The Gok's brain and the Global Public Information Network are connected through an artificial field scanning system,"Norton said.

"The first thing to do is to have the idea in your mind of asking the GPMN to help do something. Waving your hand in your ear is just a confirmation. We can also set up other gestures, such as shaking your head, making a fist, or stamping your foot ..., and people generally choose the gesture that is not easily misunderstood. And of course, purely out of their own personality, even if they are often misunderstood, they should stick to it and not change.

"You call it eating; we call it the body replenishing its chemical energy. We generally set a fixed computer program.

"Once our body lacks energy, the body automatically sends a signal to the public information network, sending the body hunger information to the Global Public Motion Network. After the global public motion network confirms, liquid chemical energy is transmitted to our body and takes away some waste excreted by our body. Everything is automatically manipulated by the program without any effort on our part.

"It's equivalent to outsourcing our body's sucking, digesting, and excreting functions."

"Haha, so there's no way for you to live without the Global Public Motion Network," I imitated Santos's tone and said to them with a smile as well. "Can you eat on the ZITU-300 ship?"

"The ZITU-300 ship also has a motion network onboard and can transmit as well. The same can refuel our bodies. You just can't see it," Santos said.

"In the absence of a global public motion network, our mouths can also drink liquid food and eat with our teeth. It's just that we Gok planet people are not used to it, and our bodies are just a hollow cavity inside, no complex digestive organs like you earthlings, digestive function is degraded, right? Really eat up, probably okay, just not as powerful as you earthlings."

"I'm a little confused. Your brain can be connected to the global information network, equivalent to the biological computer inside the brain. Why do I see you often operate those virtual screen computers again, directly with your brain can not?" I said to Norton.

"For example, in the ZITU-300 spacecraft, I saw you operate a virtual computer?"

"The biological computer of the human body is not as powerful as the external computer, and many functions like the ZITU-300 spaceship do not allow us to operate directly with our brains, which is regulated on our planet.

"And within the confines of Planet Gok, one can request the global public motion network directly through one's brain and go almost anywhere on Planet Gok as one pleases. However, starships can fly away from Planet Gok with certain dangers. Flying a spaceship is not for anyone, and even those who are allowed to operate them cannot do as they please and need approval," Norton said seriously.

"You have to understand that the built-in bio-computer of the human body has a great deal of discretion, and something like piloting the 'ZITU-300 spacecraft' requires serious caution. That's why an external computer is safer and more suitable than a built-in bio-computer."

"Oh, I kind of get it. You Gok planets also do things methodically and rationally and don't allow haphazardness," I suddenly remembered again.

"Oh, Norton, I wanted to ask you, where's your family?"

"What family?" Norton seemed a little surprised.

"Where are your parents? Where's your wife? Do you have kids?"

"Oh, just me, " Norton replied.

Ah! I didn't expect Norton, the biological scientist of Planet Gok, to be single and alone.

"What about your family? How many members of your family are there?" I asked Santos again.

"Just me. "

"And what about you?" I asked Willow, "How many people are in your family? Where are your parents? Do you have brothers and sisters?" I saw that Willow looked like a little girl on our planet and was embarrassed to ask if she had any children.

"What? I am what I am," Willow was a little baffled.

"Ah! All three of you are so pitiful. You're all orphans. It's so sad that there's no one left in the family!"

"Who's miserable? We Gok planet people are all immortal, and deathless, where are the parents, brothers and sisters, children?" Santos said disdainfully.

They can live forever? I thought to myself, according to the fantastic technology I saw on Planet Gok, they should be able to achieve immortality. How did they achieve the biggest dream of earthlings - immortality?

"Really? You can live forever?" I didn't quite believe what Santos said and turned my head to ask Norton.

"Yes, we can live forever. Many years ago, our planet Gok realized this technology," Norton affirmed Santos's words.

"We are not born or die, so there are no old people or children, no parents, brothers, and sisters. We have only one person in a family."

"It's not good to have only one person in a family. It must be lonely," I said.

"We have pets at home. I have a lot of pets, and we can talk to our pets as well as talk and communicate with other animals," Willow said, "I have two robots at home to take care of me, too."

"Are there any animals on your planet like the dogs and cats? What methods do you use to talk to them? " I asked.

"Yes, we have a lot of animals. Some of our dogs and cats are of a breed similar to those on your planet, and it is possible that this breed was introduced from your planet," Norton replied.

"We can translate our language into a language that animals like dogs and cats can understand, and then use artificial field scans to send the information to the brains of animals like dogs and cats. Artificial field scanning can also translate the language of animals like dogs and cats into a language we can understand. In this way, we can communicate with dogs and cats.

However, you are an earthling who cannot understand right now what it is like for us to communicate with animals like dogs and cats. We may not have this program for you to experience right now. You can try to think that you are talking to someone with a mental disorder. However, that doesn't prevent us from being able to communicate with animals."

"It also doesn't prevent us from being able to have sex with animals. This kind of thing happens too much on the planet Gok, but it is a very bad thing in the eyes of you earthlings," I was so surprised by Santos's words that I changed the subject.

"So do you Gok planet people have couples, friends of the opposite sex?"

"Yes, they don't usually live together. Relationships last just that long and are not permanent. Nor are they registered by law like you earthlings," Santos replied.

"You people of Planet Gok are interesting. I'd love to go out and walk among you Goks and see what your daily life is like, and back on our planet, I can brag to everyone about what you have here."

"Chienko, I'll definitely have to take you out for a walk later," Norton said, "You just arrived today, so I guess you're tired, so just rest at my place."

"Well, okay!"

"Let's say goodbye and meet here tomorrow, Karen, the customer service of Global Public Information Network, just translated the words of Santos and Willow to me, and I noticed that Willow and Santos immediately disappeared from Norton's house. There was no need to guess. They must have used the Global Public Motion Network to teleport back to their home.

The Global Public Motion Network of Planet Gok can make people and things suddenly appear and disappear in a certain place. Even more amazing is that it can be done in a sealed room.

If this were to happen on our planet, it would certainly dazzle the people of Earth. However, on Planet Gok, GPMN teleport is so frequent and common that they cannot live without GPMN in every aspect of their lives, even relying on it for food and drink.

"I want to take a bath. Do you have anything for bathing? Do you take a shower?" I asked Norton.

"Yes, I'll take you there."

I followed Norton and walked to a small room. Norton flicked a switch, and suddenly a milky white bathtub appeared in the room, suspended in the air. The milky white color was too pure, and it was flickering. No need to guess. It was a virtual bathtub, the product of an artificial field.

I walked in and saw that there was water in the bathtub. Strangely enough, the water flowed from one end of the tub to the other, and it kept flowing. I think the water was real, not virtual. How can I put it? One end of the tub was constantly bubbling with water. Where was all that water? One end is sucking up so much water. Where is the water stored? This must be something incredible on our planet.

I just wanted to ask Norton what this bathtub was all about. Suddenly I remembered the global public motion network of the Gok planet, which is presumably used to transport water at one end of the bathtub and then use the motion network to transport the water out the other end.

I jumped into the bathtub and immediately felt that the water was natural and the bathtub was virtual. The water temperature was slightly warmer than my body temperature, and it was comfortable to lie in. I want to pee. Just now, there is Willow present, too embarrassed to ask Norton where I can pee. Now in the bathtub, put a bubble of urine, Norton will find? Will not accuse me? Who cares.

I let go of the pee and took a comfortable bath. I just got out of the virtual bathtub, and in a flash, the virtual bathtub was gone, disappeared cleanly. It seems to be the magical global public motion network again to get them away.

The virtual bed in Norton's house was comfortable, and I had a good night's sleep.

When I got up, I saw Santos, Willow, and Norton already sitting on the virtual couch chatting. I wanted to go up and talk to them, suddenly I felt very urgent poop, embarrassed to ask also can not, so I blurted out, "Where is your toilet?"

"We don't have toilets. We Goks don't need to defecate or urinate," said Santos, "we have less excrement than you earthlings have earwax."

"Then there has to be a place for the Chienko to come in handy," Norton said.

"I'll take him out," Waverly said, standing up and volunteering.

I was too embarrassed to let a girl show me the way, but the situation was urgent, so I had to follow Willow out.

Willow said, "I am a very caring person. I want my friends to come and help me."

Willow was wearing a shiny purple dress underneath. From the front and back, it was quite normal; however, from the side, it was not right. The side was naked. Maybe the skirt is transparent on the side. But this kind of transparency is too advanced to be pressed. It's just that the skirt looks like a whole.

Later, I learned that their people's clothes, on many occasions, are not real. They are virtual. The global public motion network and global information network just make virtual images on their bodies, not real clothes.

If you touch them with your hands, you touch the naked body. Only if they ask the Global Public Motion Network to create a force field protection on their body, you feel it without nudity.

The delicate pink and white skin on the lower half of Willow's body makes my heart beat faster.

I swept a glance and was too embarrassed to look. I thought to myself, we women on Earth are to protect the key parts. they are good, like to naked key parts. I condemned them shamelessly in my heart. Immediately remembered that Karen introduced their planet as a horny planet.

In fact, I am a conservative-minded person. Once I was digging for eels and met a woman from the city with her daughter. They wanted to cross a ditch and were afraid of leeches and bugs in the water, so they asked me to help them. Seeing this woman in her super short skirt and pink thighs, I just didn't dare to hold.

She still instructed me to carry her over. Seeing her high breasts, I lost my courage again. This woman probably did not think I was because I did not dare to hug a woman, misunderstood me, was angry, and scolded me as a bad person scolded for a long time. Finally, had to take off shoes and grit teeth to cross over. I felt guilty of a long time.

Back to Norton's house, I proposed to go out for a walk to understand the daily life of the people of Gok planet.

Norton said, "Go next time, today there are many important guests to come, where you will also see our various people on Gok planet. "

Not long after, Norton's house came to many people, gradually feeling the living room was small. Norton waved his hand, a virtual wall disappeared, and suddenly the living room increased in size several times. It seems that the virtual house is really convenient.

Santos, Willow, and I are sitting on the virtual couch. I sit in the middle. Willow is dressed too sexy today, plus I am not wearing clothes, naked feeling, giving me an invisible pressure, I keep a distance from her.

I also saw an interesting phenomenon, some people appeared suddenly on the virtual couch in Norton's house; others appeared first as a puff of white smoke and then slowly turned into a person. I asked Santos what this was all about.

"The person who suddenly appears is coming as a real person, through the global public motion network. The smoke that slowly turns into a person is the virtual person of light. This person's real body did not come, but the real body can talk to us at a distance through the public information network. It is the global public information network, the global public motion network through three-dimensional imaging technology to create a virtual person. But virtual people can also talk to us directly," Santos gave an explanation.

I fixed my eyes. These virtual people look no different from real people. Santos is lying to me? No matter, I stood up, walked to a virtual person nearby, touched my hand on this body, as if waving it in the air, and touched nothing.

Despite the preparation in my mind, I was still shocked. Have to marvel at the amazing technology of the Gok planet people, the virtual technology to the peak of the point.

These people who came to Norton's house look different. However, the height is exactly the same, with the naked eye can not see any difference. These people are like in a symposium. Norton is in the crowd walking around, like a moderator.

Because of the crowd, the Global Information Network's customer service staff mainly translated Norton, Santos, and Willow's speeches. If I pay attention to another stranger, this person's speech will be automatically translated. Otherwise, the information network's customer service staff will not translate in general.

I think this public information network may be highly intelligent, but it may also be tracking my location from time to time.

Norton talked endlessly about the physical structure of our earthlings and occasionally introduced me to the physical structure and physiological characteristics of the people of Planet Gok.

I did not even bother to listen because there came many women from the planet Gok, or called Gok planet girls. Because their appearance is particularly young and beautiful, and all not tall.

These beautiful girls were sitting right next to me. And all dressed very revealingly. Usually dressed like Willow today - a tight sweatshirt on top and a short skirt on the bottom. And mostly exposed from the side on the delicate pink and white skin, looking at me is tickling.

Norton and Willow probably didn't know what I had in mind. Only Santos seemed to know.

"You Earth women have beautiful ones and ugly ones," Santos asked me, "So do you think all the women on our Gok planet are beautiful?"

"What you Goks call beautiful is having a sexy body and a particularly delicate body. I admit that you Gok people have smooth skin, pure color, and perfect body structure, and our Earth people's beauty is also about the connotation of people, the character of people's thoughts, and the temperament of people, which you may not understand, somewhat deliberately put on a profound look.

"If a person's body is full of small dots, grow a lot of small bags, this person is still beautiful?" Norton asked me rhetorically.

"A person with a lot of dots and pouches on his body like a toad is called beautiful? Haha, burst out laughing.

"Yes!" Norton seemed to come to life, "I'll invite such a beautiful woman over right away and turn your perception of beauty upside down."

Norton pressed his left hand to his ear, walked back and forth a few steps, and suddenly a beautiful woman appeared in front of our eyes. This beauty dazzled me. She was wearing too little clothing, and the color of her body skin was pinkish-white with a slight hint of pink. Sure enough, there were pink dots all over the body, and these dots were match-head size and very evenly distributed. Look carefully, crystal clear, a bit like pomegranate seeds. This person is beautiful and sexy at first glance.

"Well? What do you think of this person?" Norton asked me.

"Well, this person is indeed very beautiful, and I admit very sexily, think this person's beauty and sexiness still come from delicacy, just another form of delicacy. But, at this point, I didn't want to debate with Norton and the others.
